I took my family to [Kamogawa-kan](http://www.kamogawakan.co.jp) in Chiba for a couple days to relax in the onsen hotspring spa and sunbathe. Here's the brochure and general look of the place. All Cypress wood and quite beautiful inside. <br /><img class="right" src="http://rickcogley.smugmug.com/photos/349519220_5Jvgc-M.jpg" /><br />The below is a look at the front gate, and the menus for the kaiseki dinners (partial only). As well as a coaster with an artwork they own, of an "ama" diver gathering abalone, which was featured on the menu. <br />![](http://rickcogley.smugmug.com/photos/349519175_YL9gz-M.jpg "")<br />
