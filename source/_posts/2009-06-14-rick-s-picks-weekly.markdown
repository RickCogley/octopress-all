- [Daring Fireball: WWDC 2009 Predictions](http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc_2009_predictions)John Gruber's Daring Fireball WWDC 2009 predictions. —Rick Cogley ||From the site: WWDC 2009 Predictions - Sunday, 7 June 2009What I know, don’t know, and know I don’t know about tomorrow’s WWDC announcements. As usual, please, no wagering.iPhone 3GSEverything I wrote about last month in “The Next iPhone” still stands. I expect Apple to announce updated iPhones with significantly faster processors, twice the RAM, and twice the storage. I expected prices to remain the same as the current lineup: $199/299 for 16/32 GB, respectively. The video camera is going to be a major selling point.One additional tidbit I’ve heard is the new hardware’s code name: iPhone 3GS. I’m not certain that’s what it’ll be officially named, but my hunch is yes. I have no idea what the S stands for.1The other new tidbit is battery life: 15-20 percent longer than the iPhone 3G.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [daringfireball](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/daringfireball), [john gruber](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"john gruber"), [wwdc](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/wwdc), [2009](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/2009), [predictions](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/predictions)
