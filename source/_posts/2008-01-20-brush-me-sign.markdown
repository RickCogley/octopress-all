[<img class="right" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2318/2196806162_f9b2c1f81d_m.jpg" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/2196806162/) This sign on a door says "brush me" or "touch me" - "furete kudasai". Little sensors near the sign on the door frame respond to your light touch, and the door opens. I must have some kind of special gaikokujin aura, because I can never get the things to work - I have to literally touch the sensor itself and not just the sign. The newfangled Japan Rail touchpads on the ticket machines don't work for me consistently either.
