Today I did [this route](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=103784915361440638280.000455562e15ff1532d54&ll=35.410148,139.40909&spn=0.002435,0.005633&z=18&lci=lmc:panoramio), which has about 10 km of gravel and trail, 13 km of sandy asphalt, and the remaining 40 km regular paved roads or bike roads. I was very pleased with the Schwalbe Marathons I got last week. They have a good feeling, roll very well, and seem to be tough enough to go over patches of asphalt with glass shards without incident. Kudos to Schwalbe for making such a tough tire!
