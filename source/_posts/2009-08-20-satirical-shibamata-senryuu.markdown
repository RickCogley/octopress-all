The elections are again upon us here in Japan, and the satirists are hard at work writing Senryuu (川柳) poems about the subject. Senryuu are like Haiku in that they have the well-known 5-7-5 sound structure, but they differ in that they are not so much about _mother_ nature as about _human_ nature. 




You can see some Senryuu from my post about the annual [Salary-man Senryuu competition](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=9131646779081025259) held by Dai-ichi Life Insurance, about the trials of the typical salaried worker (meaning, most of Japan's population). This time, the buzz is about the upcoming House of Representatives election, and [there are several](http://mainichi.jp/select/wadai/news/20090723k0000m040034000c.html) humorous Senyruu decorating the **Shibamata Taishakuten** (柴又帝釈天) Temple in Katsushika Ward, Tokyo. These will remain on display until around early September.




Let's take a look at some of the Shibamata Senryuu, with my translations: 




> 




手袋の




Tebukuro no




白さに隠す




Shirosa ni kakusu




腹の中




Hara no naka 









> 




****




White gloves




Seem to be hiding




Your real intentions [1]














> 




大風呂敷




Oo furoshiki




にまどわされて




ni madowasarete




票を入れ




hyo wo ire









> 




****




Stunned by your




Impressive large furoshiki




I vote for you [2]














> 




バラの花




Bara no hana




咲くと公約




Saku to kouyaku




枯れてくる




Karetekuru









> 




****




As the roses bloom




Your campaign promises




Wilt away [3]














> 




字が読めず




Ji ga yomezu




末は首相と




Otto wa souri to




おだてられ




Odaterare









> 




****




Can't read the kanji!




With the Prime Minister




My husband freaks [4]














> 




マンガ好き




Manga zuki




末は首相と




Otto wa souri to




息子言う




Musuko iu









> 




****




The manga freak




My husband, gripes about




The PM and our son [5]














__




[1] The phrase "hara no naka" is a common Japanese use of the hara or "gut", or "inside your gut", your dirty intentions. 




[2] Oo furoshiki means "big talk". 




[3] They put out roses when counting votes. This implies as soon as the roses are in bloom, or the votes are being counted, politicians' promises die away. 




[4] PM Aso is infamous for making mistakes in reading kanji, which are not really so hard to read either (even I could read some of them.) The PM's and the husband's "freaking" here is for opposite reasons and the original "odateru" is more like "to become agitated".




[5] PM Aso is a big manga-lover. The writer's husband loves manga, but does not hesitate to criticize his son or the PM. 









There is considerable humor in Japanese life, so it would be shortsighted to think Japan does not enjoy it. **Enjoy!**
