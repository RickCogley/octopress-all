### Problems Sending vCards to Windows Users



In trying to send VCFs to Windows Outlook users, I discovered two problems by trial and error. First, the Windows users could not open what I was sending even if it was in English, and second, the **Japanese fonts in the vCards were garbled**. The bottom line? Use _Format version 2.1_ for the greatest compatibility and _set your language_ accordingly.
