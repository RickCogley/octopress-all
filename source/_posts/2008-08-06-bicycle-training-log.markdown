I bought a new Centurion bike last winter, and have been riding regularly. Decided to [keep a log of my travels](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/../goodies/reference/cogley-cycling-training-log.php "Bicycle Log") and hopefully chart any progress. Usually I ride down the "Fujisawa Yamato Jitenshado (cycling road)" to Enoshima, round to Kamakura and back home via Ofuna. It's a good trip for me, at about 35 km depending on which route I take. <br /><br />When I look at the average times of the Tour de France riders, I am humbled. They are incredible athletes, averaging something like 38 to 40 kph on the stages. Lance Armstrong averaged something like 40-plus kph over a whole tour, which means he was probably doing 30 uphill and 60 down. Wow!
