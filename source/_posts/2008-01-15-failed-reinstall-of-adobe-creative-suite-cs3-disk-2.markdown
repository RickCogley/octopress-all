I installed some software that overwrote some vital portion of Adobe Acrobat, so when I try starting that app, it complains, asking for a reinstall. So, embarking on the obvious course, reinstalling using the "refresh" function of the install DVD, I find out that half way through, the installer prompts for Disk 2, ExtendScript Toolkit. That would be fine, except there is no disk 2!

Much frustration and a lot of googling later, I found [this Adobe forum post](http://www.adobeforums.com/webx?14@1015.tgLXhWJIR2V@.3bc478ee/) that has the hint that you can mount ExtendScript during the reinstall and all should be well. Get ExtendScript [here](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/bridge/). Boy, there's just so many problems cited with the Adobe CS3 install, it's a sham(e). Maybe Apple needs to buy Adobe - an announcement during the Jobs keynote tomorrow, perhaps?
