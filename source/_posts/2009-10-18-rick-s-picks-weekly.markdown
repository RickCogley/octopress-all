- [blog:Cogley - Recovery of Corrupt Apple Leopard Server Open Directory](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=237991957750163395)Corrupt Apple Leopard Server Open Directory ServicesThu, Oct 15 2009 22:24 | LDAP, Open Directory, tips, software, Troubleshooting, apple | PermalinkI had a Leopard Server crash and burn so that nothing was responding, and when I forced the server to reboot (as well as rebooting a bunch of other ancillary servers and services just in case), I found an ominous sign in Server Admin, along with no user accounts in Workgroup Manager. Eek! Server Admin's Open Directory showed:[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [open](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/open), [directory](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/directory), [apple](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/apple), [leopard](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/leopard), [server](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/server), [recover](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/recover), [crash](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/crash)
