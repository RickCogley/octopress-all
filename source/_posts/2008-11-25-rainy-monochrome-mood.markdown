[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3048191610 "View 'Rain, soon, again.' on Flickr.com")I took this monochrome photo on the platform at Shinjuku station, waiting for the Shonan Shinjuku line. The black and white treatment suits its rainy mood. We have had more than our share of rain, even into the fall, so it's sunny days like today that make me feel grateful for this clear, crisp fall weather.
