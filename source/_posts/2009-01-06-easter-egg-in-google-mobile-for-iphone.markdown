[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3173481902 "View 'Google Mobile iPhone App Easter Egg' on Flickr.com")In the official Official Google Mobile Blog post [Ring in the New Year with Bells and Whistles](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/01/ring-in-new-year-with-bells-and.html), the Google Mobile for iPhone team points out an **Easter Egg** that you can use to get some additional features in Google Mobile. Just open the app, tap settings, then scroll past About. _Eventually, you'll see the additional menu_ item "Bells and Whistles" appear, so keep trying. Nice!
