*About this site*

As they say, we *stand on the shoulders of giants*, and this site is certainly no exception. After a while watching my [previous site][1] deteriorate, I decided to employ a baked style of website, which involves generating locally, and copying static HTML,  CSS  and Javascript files up to the server. There are too many [static site generators][2] these days, but due to the popularity of [**Github][3], [Jekyll][4] is a well-supported one, written in the popular [Ruby][5] language. After a lot of waffling, I decided on a wrapper around Jekyll called [Octopress][6].

You really need to be a bit of a hacker, to use a static site generator. Octopress was complete and polished enough that I could learn the related technologies at my own pace. An ulterior motive was that I wanted to learn how to use git, as all the cool kids are using it. The workflow of writing a post or page in markdown, adding it to my local git repository, committing it, pushing it, and deploying it to the site, has now become second nature. I am using Atech Mediaâ€™s [CodebaseHQ][7] and [DeployHQ][8] to host my repo and deploy its files to my site folder, over at the rock-solid [Webfaction][9].

I hired *Paul Serous*, Web Developer, ([Profile][10])</span> who is based in the Ukraine, to coach me in learning git and the other technologies I need to know, and, to do the heavy ruby programming that I have no time or need to learn. He did an exemplary job not only on those things, but going the extra mile to adapt a responsive HTML5 and CSS3 [theme][11] based on the famous and somewhat ubiquitous [Twitter Bootstrap][12], up and running on this site. I really appreciate his quality work, help and patience.

A lot goes into the cosmetic look of a site, namely with [CSS][13] for visual styling, and javascript such as [JQuery][14] or what Twitter has written into Bootstrap for effects. We started with a basic theme, but there are a lot of actors playing on the stage you see now. Iâ€™m using Adobe TypeKit [webfonts][15], namely [Freight Text Pro][16] for the body text, [Adelle][17] for the headings, and [Source Code Pro][18] for monospace code blocks, primarily because they look good, and it means a consistent look to the site for most viewers with modern browsers. Also, because [Font Awesome][19] icon fonts and [Glyphicons][20] are included with Twitter Bootstrap, those too are taken advantage of in the design.

As you browse around, you may see that [Semantic HTML][21] is the base, while Iâ€™m using some now-well-accepted [Microdata][22] such as the [Person][23] schema, and [Microformats][24] such as [hCard][25], with [rel-tag][26] sprinkled in around the site.
