[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickcogley/3275065889/ "photo sharing")Here's an isight snap via Photo Booth of my new specs from Zoff. The old ones were getting pretty crusty, so I made the excursion to Ofuna to the very popular Zoff, an inexpensive eyeglasses chain something like LensCrafters in the US, I would gather.
