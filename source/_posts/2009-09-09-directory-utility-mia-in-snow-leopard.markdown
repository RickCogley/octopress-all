_Is Directory Utility, which has been available in /Applications/Utilities, missing in action in Snow Leopard?_

* Open Apple Menu, System Preferences.

* Enter Accounts, clicking the lock to authenticate as needed.

* Click Login Options at the bottom of the accounts list.

* Click Edit, to the right of "Network Account Server."

* Click Open Directory Utility.


You use Directory Utility to connect to Active Directory, Open Directory, or other LDAP servers.
