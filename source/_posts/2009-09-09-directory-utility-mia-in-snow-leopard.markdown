[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3902386044 "View 'Snow Leopard Directory Utility Hidden' on Flickr.com")Is Directory Utility, which has been available in /Applications/Utilities, missing in action in Snow Leopard? No, it's just been moved to _Core Services_. Access it this way: 





Open Apple Menu, System Preferences.


Enter Accounts, clicking the lock to authenticate as needed.


Click Login Options at the bottom of the accounts list.


Click Edit, to the right of "Network Account Server."


Click Open Directory Utility.





You use Directory Utility to connect to Active Directory, Open Directory, or other LDAP servers.
