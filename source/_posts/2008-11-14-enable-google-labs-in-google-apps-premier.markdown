If you read my [post about enabling Google Labs in GMail](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=6971573604173705225), I'm happy to report that the trick _also works in Google Apps Premier Edition "GAPE"_. Go to the Labs tab via an URL like this (edit it so that it has your own GAPE domain). 


https://mail.google.com/a/your-gape-domain.com/?labs=1#settings/labs


Now you can have that [Google Labs](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Google_Labs.php) goodness in GAPE. Enjoy!
