[Apple - MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/)&nbsp; - wow! How do they do it?! What an incredibly slim laptop. I like my MacBook Pro because it has the ports I need in it already, but, this is typical Apple pushing (er, forcing?) the envelope by removing the network port and optical drive. Perhaps this will drive WiFi innovation or perhaps Apple has something else up their sleeves?! By the way, TimeMachine now works over wireless too - nice timing!<br /><br />**Update**: there are some caveats, of course. One, you cannot change the battery yourself, which means no spares, and is going to be a problem for travelers. Another, there is no network interface card but you can do a USB NIC if you like. Thirdly, the internal hard disk is said to be a bit on the slow side. But, it LOOKS mahvelous!<br /><br />
