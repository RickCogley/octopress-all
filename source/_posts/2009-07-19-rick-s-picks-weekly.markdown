- [Snap!Japan - Kenkoshindan Health Check](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=6411143908657011647)My wife and I did our yearly "kenkoshindan" health check via our insurance provider the other day. If you are on the national insurance plan or one of the big alternative providers, you're supposed to get this kenkoshindan once a year. My wife and my secretary at work badgered me into submission, so I finally took the plunge and got the big one-day "ningen dock" (人間ドック, and kind of like "human dry-dock" in its meaning).So What's this Ningen Dock?Glad you asked. Being over 40 (ok, ok, I'm 43), this time I signed up for the standard ningen dock set, instead of the wimpy blood and urine test only. Once you get to the center, after NOT eating breakfast, they give you a nice top/bottom to change into, so you to to a locker room, strip to your skivvies and put that on. It's not a paper gown like you might see at an ER, but a proper outfit much like pajamas. The arms were short and the bottoms were held up by a drawstring. They include socks too, in case you wear the ones with the holes (like me!) on the big day.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [kenkoshindan](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/kenkoshindan), [health](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/health), [check](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/check), [japan](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/japan)
- [blog:Cogley - Shared iTunes Music Storage](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=2157814550420721190)My family has a shared iMac G5 running Leopard OS X 10.5.7 and iTunes 8.2 (both the latest as of 13 July 2009), and recently I noticed we were running low on disk space, so I did some digging via du at the command line. I found that we were eating space by ingesting CDs into iTunes, which would get copied to our respective local user folders.After a little research, I found the Apple KB article that describes how to have a single storage location for music, so I set that up and made some other discoveries in the process. I thought I'd share how I did it.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [productivity](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/productivity), [itunes](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/itunes), [shared](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/shared), [library](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/library), [music](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/music)
