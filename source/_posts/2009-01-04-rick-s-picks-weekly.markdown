- [Listing Open Directory Users on OS X Leopard with DSCL or DSCACHEUTIL](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=6335418846946693970)If you want get a list of your users on Open Directory in Leopard Server, you need to use the dscl or dscacheutil from the Terminal. SSH to your server, and do a sudo bash or su - to get into root mode. Then you can run the commands directly with their arguments, which I show in this post. -- Rick Cogley[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [rick cogley](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"rick cogley"), [dscacheutil](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/dscacheutil), [dscl](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/dscl), [open directory](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"open directory"), [users](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/users), [terminal](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/terminal)

[Cleaning House on Leopard Server](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=4043303826781853549)


If you administer OS X servers, chances are the holidays are a time when projects to perform IMACs (1) are often done. Projects that involve moving drives or data. On Leopard Server, to get a clean start for 2009, there are a few command line techniques to note regarding permissions for files and folders. Note, setting permissions in Finder on OS X Server is notoriously buggy, so 9 out of 10 administrators (in white coats, of course) recommend using the command line. Try it: your friends will envy you and the girls will admire you. But first, a word about how permissions work in Leopard Server.

[You can't empty the Trash or move a file to the Trash in Mac OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1526)


Apple KB article on problematic trash and other anomalies. Worth bookmarking. --Rick CogleyFrom the site: In Mac OS X, each user account has a separate, invisible Trash folder that is in the home folder. When you view contents of the Trash, you see only items you placed there and not the Trash folder of any other accounts. If other writable volumes are present, you may also have individual Trash folders on these volumes.

- [David Seah - The Printable CEO™ Series](http://davidseah.com/index.php/blog/the-printable-ceo-series)I use a combination of tools to keep organized, but these paper files are pleasantly analog. Give them a look. --Rick CogleyFrom the site: "The Printable CEO™ (PCEO) was born from a desire to focus my time more productively. For me, that means things that make my freelance practice sustainable and fun. The Printable CEO name comes from the idea that a good CEO should focus primarily on those things that move the company forward; since I can't afford to hire my own CEO, being able to print one out seemed like the next best thing! :-)In general, I use only one form at a time depending on what my    * High Level Goal Tracking for Freelancers and Small Business Owners - Use the Concrete Goals Tracker (CGT)    * Project-level Task Tracking - Use the Task Progress Tracker (TPT)    * Realistic Daily Planning - Use the Emergent Task Planner (ETP)    * Keeping Track of Planned versus Unplanned Stuff that Happens - Use the Emergent Task Timer (ETT)    * Keeping Track of Individual Task Assignments - Use the Task Order Up (TOU)"[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [david seah](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"david seah"), [printable ceo](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"printable ceo"), [pceo](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/pceo), [paper](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/paper)
