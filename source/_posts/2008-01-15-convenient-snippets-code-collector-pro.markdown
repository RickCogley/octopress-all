Ed from the RapidWeaver forum tipped me off for [CodeCollector Pro](http://www.getcodecollector.com/) from Before Dawn Solutions. Here is what their site says - 

{% blockquote %}
Welcome to the snippet revolution. When you spend all day writing code, it is only natural to start having feelings of déjà vu. Didn’t you write that same few lines of code a few days ago, and again a few days before that? Why are you wasting time re-writing that code again and again? Code Collector Pro is the answer, giving you the ability to store snippets of code and retrieve them with a few keystrokes.
{% endblockquote %} 

Looks like the perfect little app to collect up snippets of javascripts etc.
