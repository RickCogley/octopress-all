[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3074263774 "View 'Custom 404 page with RapidWeaver' on Flickr.com")I created a tutorial about [Error Handling in RapidWeaver Websites](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/rick-cogley-error-handling-in-rapidweaver.php) which explains how to make a custom 404 page with useful links to help your visitors when a 404 does occur, and how to use 301 redirects in your .htaccess file to assist with page renaming or re-pathing. 


A 301 redirect just points the visitor at the new file you specify, when they try to visit the old file. Useful for adds, moves and changes. The tutorial has a lot more detail than what is in this post, so please take a look at it. I hope it is useful to someone.
