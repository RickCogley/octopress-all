Hopefully they will be kind enough to reinstate me. Tread with care. **


It allows you to do several things: 





Auto-follow people based on keywords they use in their tweets, limited to five keywords you select.


Auto-respond to Twitter users who add you, with a boilerplate tweet.


Auto-reply to "people who add you to twitter". (I think this means automatically send a reply any time anyone references your username with the @username syntax, but I am not sure.)


Tweet at specific times in the near future.


Have Twautor tweet new entries in your RSS feed. 





### My Observations after a Day with Twautor



I have used Twautor over the last day, and _got a bunch of new followers based on the keywords I selected_: Japan, iPhone, Bike, Cycling. Anytime someone used one of those words, my Twautor auto-followed them for me and sent this tweet: 





> Thanks for adding me. My site is http://is.gd/cwE6 , I've been in Japan 21 years, and I like photography, cycling, drumming & the web.





**That tweet sent**, some of the people I added, added me back in return. After that, I sent messages (manually, of course) to everyone saying hello from Japan and so on. I managed to irritate some people at first because I mistakenly enabled "auto reply" in Twautor, but I had nothing in the reply box. Twautor was dutifully replying for me, with an empty tweet! Sorry about that. Also, because it auto-follows accounts for you, you end up with a bunch of news bots as well. I went through and blocked any of those I did not want to see, so I have to say the automatic approach is a bit "shotgun". 


**Twautor is an interesting and useful service**. I hope the author of Twautor will clean up the grammar in the interface to make the descriptions a little more precise, but I am enjoying the ability to find people who might have something in common easily. 


**Update - **Oops. Using Twautor got me suspended! Tread with care.
