_The "Vegetarian" Fresh Juice Bar located in the New Shimbashi building 1st floor, has been in business for 40 years. It is worth a visit if you are in the area (Shimbashi station is just south of Tokyo station on the Yamanote line.)_

Prices are reasonable at 300 to 700 JPY, with egg or veg-fruit sandwiches available cheaply for juice customers.


Example juices - 


- Parsley パセリ

- Kale ケール

- Goya ゴーヤ

- Celery セロリ

- Blueberry ブルーベリー

- Strawberry いちご

- Melon メロン

- Aloe アロエ

- Shungiku 春菊

- Komatsuna 小松菜

- "Hard" Veg ハード野菜



... and various others. Most of the juices have a bit of fruit in them, and they seem to be putting red grapefruit in with the parsley and kale juice. The "hard" yasai is 7 types of veg mixed together, and is veg only, and "harder to drink" according to the hardworking ladies of Vegetarian.
