- [blog:Cogley - Changing a Bike Inner-tube](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=339235189521449679)I got a flat the last hill of my 100 km bike trip last Sunday. Thank heavens it did not happen at km 50 or something. I went to a bike shop in Shinjuku today to get a replacement tube, and they were kind enough to tutor me on how to replace it.How to Change that TubeHere's the process I learned at the bike shop:Purchase a tube, tire levers (they come in sets of three, usually) and rim tape of the appropriate size. My rims are 26 inch with 1.5 Schwalbe Marathons on them now, and you just have to be sure what you buy is the right size. If you can give them the rim size, that's better too. The tubes come with various valves, and I have "French" valves now so that is what I got. All told, the cost to buy the parts was about JPY 1300 (USD 13).[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [bike](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/bike), [cycling](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/cycling), [inner-tube](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/inner-tube), [change](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/change), [rim](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/rim), [tape](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/tape), [spoke](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/spoke)
