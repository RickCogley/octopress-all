[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/2979878353 "View 'New Google Labs Features - Google Calendar and Docs or other Gadgets in Gmail' on Flickr.com")You might have noticed a couple of **new Google Labs features** available in Gmail. If you have your [Google Labs tab enabled](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=6971573604173705225), you can go there, scroll to the bottom, and check the _new Google Gadget-related _features out. Now you can get a Calendar view or a Docs view via Gadgets right within your Gmail, or specify any Gadget URL as well. Google moves so fast sometimes it is hard to keep up. Nice to have the new features, though!
