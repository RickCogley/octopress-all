[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3099666409 "View 'New iPhone, home screen' on Flickr.com")After (finally!) getting a new iPhone and contract from Softbank here in Japan, just like I did with [Mac Keyboard Shortcuts](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/rick-cogley-mac-keyboard-shortcuts.php), I struggled a bit with the "tap sequences" one needs to learn to be able to input text or navigate efficiently in this superior smartphone. 


### How to Manipulate the iPhone with Taps and Button Presses



For convenience, I [compiled a list of iPhone "Tap Tips"](/resources/rick-cogley-iphone-tap-tips/), or shortcuts for tapping and pressing the buttons and interface of the iPhone, which I hope will be useful to iPhone users. 


For instance, _do you know what these sequences do?_ 





Triple-click the mic clicker.


Double-press the home button.


Double-tap space when entering text.





If not, take a peek at my "[iPhone Tap Tips](/resources/rick-cogley-iphone-tap-tips/)" list for the answers and more, and most of all, **Enjoy**!
