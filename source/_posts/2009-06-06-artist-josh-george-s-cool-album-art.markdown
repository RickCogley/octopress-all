_I bought the Pat Metheny Trio's "Day Trip" album and "Tokyo Day Trip" EP today, and really loved the album art._

There's even "Cat Metheny" in there, too. Check out Josh's [website](http://www.joshgeorge.com) or [blog](http://joshgeorge.blogspot.com/2008/07/pat-metheny-tokyo-day-trip-ep.html), and then go buy some of his art. 

So how's the music? The Pat Metheny Trio with Pat on guitar (what else?), Christian McBride on bass, and Antonio Sanchez on drums is **stellar**. If you're a jazz fan you're sure to love it.
