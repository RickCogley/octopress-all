- [Zaditen Allergy Medicine - Snap!Japan - a long-term resident's perspective](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan)"Zaditen", an allergy medicine from Novartis, is now available over-the-counter in Japan. Last year it was by prescription only, but I'm blogging about it because it works for me where little else did. It's about 1800 yen for a 20 capsule pack, which seems expensive but "welcome to Japan" eh?

- [The Twitter Hall of Shame: 50 Tweets That Will Echo in History](http://www.pop-go.com/y7)Just as the sign says - "twitter hall of shame". Some interesting stuff here. Makes ya think. -- Rick Cogley | From the site: Twitter is a fun Web 2.0 communications tool that allows users to deliver quick messages of 140 characters or less. The hastiness and ephemeral nature of these messages means that Twitter has become more than a communication tool — it's a source of angry, funny and awkward messages that would be sometimes best left unsaid. Whether they're embarrassing or just interesting, these tweets are worth preserving.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [pop-go](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/pop-go), [twitter](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/twitter), [hall of shame](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"hall of shame")
- [The 2009 Hollywood Portfolio from Annie Leibovitz | vanityfair.com](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/03/actors-directors-portfolio200903)An outstanding set of photographs of directors and actors by Annie Leibovitz. A must-see with good commentary next to each photo. -- Rick Cogley | From the site: Something Just Clicked - Some of these actor-director teams have a history together—remember Ron Howard and Tom Hanks’s breakthrough, Splash, a quarter-century ago?—while others produced their first mind-melds in 2008. Sam Mendes and Kate Winslet even brought marriage and kids to the Revolutionary Road set. But in each case the chemistry was profound, the effect exponential. From Gus Van Sant and Sean Penn to John Patrick Shanley and Meryl Streep, Annie Leibovitz photographs 10 partnerships that helped generate more than four dozen Oscar nominations this season. Related: Krista Smith goes behind the scenes at the shoots.

- [Agile Adoption Patterns at Agile & Lean Software Development by Richard Durnall](http://www.richarddurnall.com/?p=57)Excellent intro to the types of problems organizations hit when they try to go Agile. -- Rick CogleyFrom the site - Agile Adoption PatternsPublished by richard durnall on Feb 10th, 2007 in Coaching with No CommentsI find the patterns that emerge from repeated tasks really interesting. When I first started coaching teams there was no way I could give the team or the organisation any predictions about what they were about to go through. A few years later I find it’s a very different story. I’ve found that no matter the industry, city, size or culture of the organisation, things always break in a common order…[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [agile](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/agile), [richard durnall](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"richard durnall"), [adoption](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/adoption)

However, the process of finding the software that’s most appropriate for you can be very confusing. There are lots of competing project management systems out there and each has different strengths and weaknesses. This research guide will help you sort through the options by asking some key questions and sharing comparative information about several of the systems currently available.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [pm](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/pm), [projectmanagement](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/projectmanagement), [project management](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"project management"), [design](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/design)
- [Snap!Japan - The Carpenters played daily in Japan school](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=9109586919999961396)Every morning on Japanese TV lately, there's a commercial segment that plays a cover of "Top of the World" by The Carpenters. I knew that The Carpenters were popular here, having seen their songs on many a karaoke menu and heard them played pretty consistently. I had mentioned their popularity in Japan to an American friend, who was baffled by it, and I laughingly mentioned this to my wife this AM.She told me that their songs have been played for years in our local Gumisawa Elementary and in other Elementary Schools around Japan.
