- [Snap!Japan - Japan Marine Day's Imperial Roots](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=323264021829600505)The third Monday in July is "Marine Day" here in Japan, called "Umi no Hi" (海の日) in Japanese. It was established in 1996, a few years into my life in Japan. It's common knowledge that the day marks the return of the Emperor Meiji from a boat trip. More specifically, it's the day of his return to Yokohama port in Meiji 9 (1876), from a royal light-house inspection tour to the northernmost prefectures, on a Scottish-built schooner called the "Meiji Maru".[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [umi](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/umi), [no](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/no), [hi](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/hi), [marine](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/marine), [day](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/day), [japan](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/japan)
