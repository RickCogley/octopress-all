I tried the hilly, hilly East route again this weekend, and made it all the way to [Hakkeijima Sea Paradise](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Hakkeijima_Sea_Paradise.php), which is an awesome place to take the family. The trip was about 45 km, and I dragged the [Nikon D90](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Nikon_D90.php) in my quite-rugged [Speed Freak](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016XKO0G/?tag=rickcogleyweb-20) waist pack from [Think Tank Photo](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Think_Tank_Photo.php), and took a few shots of the bridges in that area with a wide angle lens. 


When I tried to cross the main bridge to Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, thinking I'd get some lunch there, I was greeted with a blasted announcement aimed right at me. "No Bicycles Allowed in Hakkeijima Sea Paradise. Please use the bicycle parking lot behind you on the left." Actually it was more like "NO BICYCLES ALLOWED!" And of course it was in Japanese. I was so surprised by the volume I nearly fell off! (It was definitely cranked to 11) So much for lunch at Hakkeijima. I got a lot of evil stares (like Ultraman), and then some laughs because I understood the warning fully, and that it was aimed at this helmet-wearing, waist-pack toting white-boy gaijin, but at least I did not get [fined 98.00 bucks for my 6 feet](http://istanbultea.typepad.com/largefellaonabike/2008/09/9800-for-6-feet.html).
