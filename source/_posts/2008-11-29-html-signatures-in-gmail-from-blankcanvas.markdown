[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3067565336 "View 'HTML Signatures in GMail - from Blank Canvas' on Flickr.com")I found a very useful Firefox plugin from "[Blank Canvas](http://blankcanvasweb.com)", that enables your GMail to have HTML signatures. Because it is a Firefox plugin, I thought it might work in Flock, and sure enough, it does. Once you install it [from this page](http://blankcanvasweb.com/pages/detail/id_9/n_gmail_signatures/) on Blank Canvas' site, and restart your browser, you can create your signature in GMail's Compose window. This had been a GreaseMonkey script but the author converted it to a Firefox plugin. Thank you, Blank Canvas for a very useful tool.
