[Bookdog Bookmark Safari-to-Delicious Sync Software | Sheep Systems](http://www.sheepsystems.com/products/bookdog)


Bookdog works well if you have an iPhone, and want to keep your Delicious bookmarks synced with your Safari bookmarks (and therefore your iPhone bookmarks). From the website: "Bookdog allows users to sort (selectively alphabetize), import/export, migrate, verify, find redirects, search, and find duplicates among their bookmarks collections in Safari, Firefox 1.5-3.0, Camino, Google Bookmarks, del.icio.us, OmniWeb, Opera, Shiira 2.x and Netscape Navigator. Migrations can be scheduled using Apple's Automator, and bookmarks on other networked Macs or backup disks are easily accessible. "

[BusyBlog: Google CalDAV versus BusySync](http://blog.busymac.com/blog/2008/12/google-caldav-versus-busysync.html)


Although it's nice to have Google's native support for iCal sync with Google Calendar, BusySync is a viable alternative to Google's rather spartan implementation, as of 10 Dec 2008. From the site: "Google recently announced that Google Calendar now supports the CalDAV protocol enabling users to sync calendars on Google Calendar with iCal. BusySync offers similar functionality for syncing iCal with Google Calendar. We have received many questions about how BusySync compares to Google CalDAV. "
