I decided to create some Google "My Maps" to show the bike routes I take near my house in Yokohama, Japan. There are some really nice routes along the Sakai and Mekujiri Rivers. See them here: [Rick Cogley's Bicycle Routes - Mostly in Japan](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/cogley-bicycle-routes.php).
