_Phishing is a problem you hear about in the news, and you like to think of yourself as immune. I clicked a link that came in from a friend, and luckily, I noticed it was a phishing site._

###What's phishing, and what can you do about it? 

[{% img right http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8459010101_9a0586e3e9_d.jpg 400 'Click to view on Flickr: How to spot a phisher.' 'Annotated screenshot on how to spot a phishing site.' %}](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickcogley/8459010101)I have no patience for the small-minded wastrel "phisher" scum who sit there developing all manner of ways to scam people. To _phish_ is to "fish" for information from unsuspecting people, by presenting a website that looks exactly like that of your bank website, or social network site such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+ and so on. You see a link in an email, click on it, and are presented with a login website. You might then proceed to enter their login and password information there, but in the case of a phishing site, you are simply passing your name and password to the phishing scoundrel who set the site up.
