It's said on the internets that Microsoft has replaced its Japanese Windows error messages with Haiku poems (5-7-5 syllables). Apologies to Basho and to the creative souls who made these originally.

Your file was so big.
It might be very useful.
But now it is gone.

{% blockquote %}
The web site you seek
Cannot be located, but
Countless more exist.

{% blockquote %}
Chaos reigns within.
Reflect, repent, and reboot.
Order will return.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Program aborting:
Close all that you have worked on.
You ask far too much.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Windows NT crashed.
I am the Blue Screen of Death.
No one hears your screams.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Yesterday it worked.
Today it is not working.
Windows is like that.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
First snow, then silence.
This thousand dollar screen dies
So beautifully.

With searching comes loss
And the presence of absence:
"My Novel" not found.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao--until
You bring fresh toner.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Stay the patient course.
Of little worth is your ire.
The network is down.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
A crash reduces
Your expensive computer
To a simple stone.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Three things are certain:
Death, taxes and lost data.
Guess which has occurred?
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
You step in the stream,
But the water has moved on.
This page is not here.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Out of memory.
We wish to hold the whole sky,
But we never will.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Having been erased,
The document you're seeking
Must now be retyped.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Serious error.
All shortcuts have disappeared.
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.
