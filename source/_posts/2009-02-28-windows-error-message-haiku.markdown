It's said on the internets that Microsoft has replaced its Japanese Windows error messages with Haiku poems (5-7-5 syllables). Apologies to Basho and to the creative souls who made these originally.

Your file was so big.


It might be very useful.


But now it is gone.

<br />
The web site you seek


Cannot be located, but


Countless more exist.

<br />
Chaos reigns within.


Reflect, repent, and reboot.


Order will return.

<br />
Program aborting:


Close all that you have worked on.


You ask far too much.

<br />
Windows NT crashed.


I am the Blue Screen of Death.


No one hears your screams.

<br />
Yesterday it worked.


Today it is not working.


Windows is like that.

<br />
First snow, then silence.


This thousand dollar screen dies


So beautifully.

<br />
With searching comes loss


And the presence of absence:


"My Novel" not found.

<br />
The Tao that is seen


Is not the true Tao--until


You bring fresh toner.

<br />
Stay the patient course.


Of little worth is your ire.


The network is down.

<br />
A crash reduces


Your expensive computer


To a simple stone.

<br />
Three things are certain:


Death, taxes and lost data.


Guess which has occurred?

<br />
You step in the stream,


But the water has moved on.


This page is not here.

<br />
Out of memory.


We wish to hold the whole sky,


But we never will.

<br />
Having been erased,


The document you're seeking


Must now be retyped.

<br />
Serious error.


All shortcuts have disappeared.


Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

<br />
