I've lived in Japan since 1987, and it never ceases to amaze me about the way there's constant apology going on for fairly trivial stuff, but none when it's <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> needed. Anyway, I'm probably guilty of apologizing too much myself, having been here in Japan so long. This video [Apologies: The Japanese Tradition](http://www.glumbert.com/media/apology), provenance unknown, is a fairly hysterical look at apology here, and is spot on. Check out the guy's facial expressions - quite humorous in places.
