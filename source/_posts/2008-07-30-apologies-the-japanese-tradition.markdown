I've lived in Japan since 1987, and it never ceases to amaze me about the way there's continual apology going on for fairly trivial stuff, but none to speak of when it's <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> warranted. Anyway, I'm probably guilty of apologizing too much myself, having been here in Japan so long. 

This video: [Apologies: The Japanese Tradition](http://www.glumbert.com/media/apology), provenance unknown, is a fairly hysterical look at apology here, and is spot on. Check out the actor's facial expressions - quite humorous in places.
