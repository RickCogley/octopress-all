[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3307753475 "View 'Waterless Urinal "Yuuri"' on Flickr.com")Some places in Japan are very much concerned with the environment. I know we sure do a lot of trash separation, but I had to snap a picture of the sign above a special "ecological" urinal today. I am sure I got a few looks for that! 


The "Yuuri" urinal sign says:

### Non-Water System "Yuuri"



Yuuri is an ecological toilet that does not use water. Because it does not use water, water is conserved **, and CO2 gas emissions can be reduced. By the way, for every 1 liter saved, 0.58 grams of CO2 emission can be reduced. Yuuri is effective for both water conservation and reducing global warming.


No smoking. Do not put cigarette butts or gum etc in the urinal.


**** Note**: Japanese write fairly redundantly like this literal translation, restating things so they can be absolutely sure people understand. 


Al Gore would be proud.
