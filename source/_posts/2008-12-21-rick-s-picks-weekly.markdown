- [TweetDeck Twitter Client built on Adobe AIR](http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta)This is a Twitter app built in Adobe AIR, and is very good. Can't search in Japanese (or I bet other multi-byte languages), can't block users. I think Twhirl beats this in several respects. From the site - "TweetDeck enables users to split their main feed (All Tweets) into topic or group specific columns allowing a broader overview of tweets. The default columns can contain All Tweets from your timeline, @replies directed to you and direct messages. The GROUP, SEARCH and REPLIES buttons then allow the user to make up additional columns populated from the live tweet information. Once created these additional columns will automatically update allowing the user to keep track of a twitter threads far easier."[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [twitter](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/twitter), [tweetdeck](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/tweetdeck), [air](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/air), [microblogging](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/microblogging), [software](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/software), [twittertools](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/twittertools), [adobe](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/adobe), [adobeair](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/adobeair)
- [Telestream ScreenFlow - Overview](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm)Screenflow looks interesting, and must compete with SnapzPro X and iShowU in the screencasting space on Mac. I think I will try it. From the site: "ScreenFlow is an application for creating amazing screen recordings on your Mac. Using a unique new screen capture system, powerful enough to capture the contents of your entire desktop at the same time as your video camera, microphone and computer's audio, you'll be creating incredible screencasts in no time."[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [Telestream](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/Telestream), [ScreenFlow](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/ScreenFlow), [screencast](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/screencast), [screencasting](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/screencasting), [snapzpro](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/snapzpro), [ishowu](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/ishowu)
- [The Big Lebowski (1998) - Memorable quotes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes)I love this movie. "Maude Lebowski: What do you do for recreation?The Dude: Oh, the usual. I bowl.

- [David Croy - Tuesday’s Rant: Amateur Hour](http://davidcroy.wordpress.com/2008/12/16/tuesdays-rant-amateur-hour)David Croy has a point. Looking things up these days is so easy due to Google, people might start thinking that coming by that knowledge is easy. From the post: "There is an idea that seems to be prevalent lately that there is not much to be known about anything. This link is a potshot (assuming it’s not a hoax), but there is abroad what I think of as a late mutation of the self-esteem movement: that our own knowledge is the only knowledge. The lady in the clip (to whom we’re all supposed to feel superior (when frankly we should be ashamed at the depths we’re willing to allow our educational system to sink to)) does something that a lot of us do: takes her own assumptions as totally, unquestioningly valid. From there it’s not a big leap to start spinning harebrained theories.

- [Twautor - Make Your Life Simple, Twitter Style (BUT IT GETS YOU SUSPENDED)](http://www.twautor.com/index.php)Despite the grammar bugs, Twautor is a very interesting tool, that lets you auto-reply and auto-add. Like ping.fm, it's probably best used sparingly. CAREFUL! THIS GOT ME SUSPENDED from TWITTER.

[Use ping.fm in a focused way, not to spam.](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=8650314764030234520)


Ping.fm is powerful and you can mass-update social netowrking services. I would avoid that, and use it in a focused way.
