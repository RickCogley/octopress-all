- [Niigata's Anti-Miniskirt Crusade - Snap!Japan - a long-term resident's perspective](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=1870685382203233753)Niigata's Dubious Claim to "Fame" - The Shortest Skirts. Here's a screenshot of a couple images of the posters being used in Niigata prefecture's crusade to try to prevent girls' skirts from getting any shorter. That Niigata has the girls with the shortest skirts is a dubious claim to "fame" unless you're a lecher or a horny male high-school student.

[20 cynical project management tips | IT Project Failures | ZDNet.com](http://blogs.zdnet.com/projectfailures/?p=2024)


Accurate, funny, cynical list of project management truisms. -- Rick Cogley | Ever wonder why so many projects fail? Well, here’s your guide to the seamy underbelly of IT project management. From Tony Collins, who writes a well-researched blog on government-related IT failures in the UK:   1. Projects with realistic budgets and timetables don’t get approved   2. The more desperate the situation the more optimistic the progress report   3. A user is somebody who rejects the system because it’s what he asked for   4. The difference between project success and failure is a good PR company

- [blog:Cogley - Guerilla Collaboration](http://rick.cogley.info/blog)Aaron Fulkerson, the CEO at Mindtouch - makers of the awesome mashable wiki "Deki" - writes about the state of collaboration in his post Three Decades Later. Revolt Or Die.As Aaron mentions, the current state of affairs with regard to collaboration is very much email centric. However, email is terrible for collaboration. If you have never given this much though, sit a moment and really think through what it means to try to manage a project, with file versioning, in email. If you think on it, you can see how easily email can snowball out of hand, with noone on the team knowing what file or which piece of info is the current, latest version.I know this from painful experience. We have had to manage very large projects via email, because of the strong resistance at the client to any web-based applications. People have been adamant: "we use email for everything." Yikes. There are even project management applications that cater (pander?) to this attitude, like Wrike.

[Project Flow & Tracker](http://projectflowandtracker.com)


Interesting Agile tool concept to be built upon Drupal CMS. -- Rick Cogley | From the site: PFT is an Agile tool to develop web applications with Drupal. Built in Drupal itself with commonly used modules such as CCK, Views, and Organic Groups, it is both a construction kit and a staging ground for best practices. Business objects are translated into roles and user stories, mapped onto a selection of Drupal modules, and then planned as a self-documenting list of tasks assigned to various iterations, with issue and acceptance test tracking and integration with version control and other staging tools.

- [An Agile Workflow « AvailAgility](http://availagility.wordpress.com/2009/02/25/an-agile-workflow)I'm interested in these topics lately. Karl Scotland is examining a mix of kanban and agile. -- Rick Cogley | From the site: An Agile Workflow - A common topic of discussion around kanban is whether the workflows or stages in a kanban system are counter to the Agile principles of cross functional and collaborative teams.   Its easy to talk about a feature going through the following flow in a kanban system:    Analysis –> Build –> Test –> Releasewhich I confess looks very waterfall-ish and I can understand why this can raise warning flags about the suitability of the kanban approach.  This got me thinking about how best to express a typical agile-friendly workflow.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [availagility](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/availagility), [agile](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/agile), [kanban](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/kanban), [karl scotland](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"karl scotland")

- [Instructional design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design)Thanks to Amanda Fenton, I'm thinking about how to apply ID to IT projects, especially the training part. Hopefully ID will help communications about projects...  --Rick Cogley | From the site: Instructional Design is the practice of creating instructional tools and content to help facilitate learning most effectively. The process consists broadly of determining the current state and needs of the learner, defining the end goal of instruction, and creating some "intervention" to assist in the transition. Ideally the process is informed by pedagogically tested theories of learning and may take place in student-only, teacher-led or community-based settings. The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed. There are many instructional design models but many are based on the ADDIE model with the phases analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.As a field, instructional design is historically and traditionally rooted in cognitive and behavioral psychology. However, because it is not a regulated, well-understood field, the term 'instructional design' has been co-opted by or confused with a variety of other ideologically-based and / or professional fields. Instructional design, for example, is not graphic design, although graphic design (from a cognitive perspective) could play an important role in Instructional Design. Preparing instructional text by E. Misanchuk, Instructional-Design Theories and Models edited by Charles M. Reigeluth, and publications by James Hartley are useful in informing the distinction between instructional design and graphic design.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [wikipedia](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/wikipedia), [design](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/design), [instructional](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/instructional), [learning](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/learning), [ID](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/ID), [amanda fenton](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"amanda fenton")
