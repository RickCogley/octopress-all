Microsoft released a new [Remote Desktop Client](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/help.mspx?MODE=pv&CTT=PageView&clr=99-6-0&target=870500bb-d48d-4f90-b993-7d5a3f6f654c1033) version 2, with a useful multi-session feature (the previous version could only connect one Windows system at a time). Download it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.mspx).
