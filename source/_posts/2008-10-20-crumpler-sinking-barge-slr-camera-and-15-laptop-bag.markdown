To protect the [Nikon D90](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Nikon_D90.php) and allow me to maintain my sanity while commuting with my computer equipment as well, I bought a black and grey [Crumpler](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Crumpler.php) Sinking Barge bag, which holds a 15" laptop like a Macbook Pro (not the 17" version, though), an SLR and medium-sized lens, one extra lens, and has enough room for a flash, cables and so on. Today I am carrying all that plus a change of clothes.


[Crumpler](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Crumpler.php) has a zany flash-based website that you just have to experience. It is like a big vending machine, complete with some funny off-color product demonstration vids featuring employees. Good stuff. 


**What I like about it** is that it looks smooth, not like your typical camera bag, has excellent zippers and workmanship, and protects my usual equipment quite well. **If I have any criticism**, it is that some of the pockets are a little tight to insert a hand, there is no place for a monopod to be clipped (you need to get the bigger [Crumpler](http://rick.cogley.info/topics_files/Crumpler.php) models for that), and the inside flap is overly long. Overall, it's perfect for my needs.
