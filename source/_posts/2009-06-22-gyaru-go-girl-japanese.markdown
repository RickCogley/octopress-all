_**Mezamashi TV** broadcasted a segment on the lastest 'gyaru' (gal) language. If you're not familiar, gyaru are the sort of schoolgirls who hang out in Shibuya or Harajuku, dress in the latest fashion and speak in a sort of code._

<!--more--> 

Here's the three slang words I remember: 

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>ムカTK mukaTK</strong> - mukatsuku, to be pissed off. </div>{% endraw %}

The original's just as easy, ladies.

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>モレる moreru</strong> - um, to be dressed up, with your hair in a bun with cute accessories. </div>{% endraw %} 

Comes from "moritsukeru" to decorate. 

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>シカメ shikame</strong> - from shikato and meeru, ignore mail. To have blown off answering someone's text message. </div>{% endraw %}

I hear that a large percentage of schoolkids get _really stressed_ about "shikame".


At any rate, remembering these is one thing, but using them is another, so remember this: if an "oyaji" (middle-aged guy) like me uses gyaru-go, he's **ostracized** by his daughters and subjected to the "**uzai**" label for all time. :-)
