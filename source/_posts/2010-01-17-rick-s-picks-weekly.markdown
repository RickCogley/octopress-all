- [blog:Cogley - Handle Leading Zeros in Apple Numbers](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=4258324323398027320)Apple's iWork '09 Numbers spreadsheet is a versatile app with a lot of power available if you open your mind and don't expect it to be Excel. It does not quite do everything Excel does, but it handles UTF-8 well (where Excel does not and has never), and I take advantage of that often. I also love the formatting options and the multiple-sheets-per-document paradigm, but that is a different post.One challenge in both Excel and Numbers is how to handle fields with numbers with leading zeros. For instance, a part number 001234 will come out as 1234 when you import it from a CSV in either app, and lose meaning if the actual part must include the leading zeros. You can set a cell or column format in Excel as 000000, and this works the same way in Numbers, except the method's a little unfamiliar.How to Format a Part Number Field to Preserve Leading Zeros[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [apple](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/apple), [iwork](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/iwork), [numbers](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/numbers), [zeros](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/zeros), [text](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/text), [format](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/format)
