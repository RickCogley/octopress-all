[Ping.fm](http://ping.fm/) is an interesting service that lets you update your social networks simultaneously. You set up your social networks, such as Plaxo, Blogger, Twitter, Linked-in (30+ sites are supported), and then post to them in various ways. You can post from your ping.fm dashboard page, or via email or chat client. That said, I know I would be kind of irritated to get the same exact post from a person on multiple networks. 


### Don't Inundate Your Readers



I would say it's important to _use a powerful service like ping.fm with care_, and in a very specific way. Currently, I have the special email address from ping.fm in my address book, and I am updating only business-related sites like Linked-In with a status related to my professional situation. 


**UPDATE** - Ping.fm was not working for Plaxo updates up until 30 Dec 2008, but now it is fixed. 


Ping away!
