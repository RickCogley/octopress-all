I could not find this information in the help file or on the CocoaTech forum. If you use [CocoaTech's](http://www.cocoatech.com) Path Finder, the Finder replacement that has a lot of extra functionality that is missing in the normal OS X Finder, you may be browsing around in a folder with many subfolders, and wish to somehow "collapse" the folders you opened, to clean up the view. 


Clicking the disclosure triangle of 100 open subfolders is _rather tedious_, so isn't there an easier way? I stumbled on a method. Here it is.


### How to Collapse All Subfolders in Path Finder






In list view, select all. Command-A.


Press Option-Left Arrow.


Sit back, amused, but don't do anything boneheaded like pressing Command-Delete.





And voila! Collapsed folders.
