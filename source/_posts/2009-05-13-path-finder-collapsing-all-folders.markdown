_I could not find this information in the help file or on the CocoaTech forum. Clicking the disclosure triangle to close each of 100 open subfolders is _rather tedious_, so isn't there an easier way? I stumbled on a method. Here it is._

If you use [CocoaTech's](http://www.cocoatech.com) Path Finder, the Finder replacement that has a lot of extra functionality that is missing in the normal OS X Finder, you may be browsing around in a folder with many subfolders, and wish to somehow "collapse" the many subfolders you opened, to clean up the view. 

### How to Collapse All Subfolders in Path Finder

1. In list view, select all. Command-A.
1. Press Option-Left Arrow.
1. Sit back, amused, but don't do anything boneheaded like pressing Command-Delete.

And voila! Collapsed folders.
