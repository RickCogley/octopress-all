Instead, use something memorable but hard to guess as a root, followed by something unique to each system. Say you like the poem Invictus, by William Ernest Henley. You could use the famous “I am the captain of my soul” as: 

Iatcoms

Maybe mix it by adding a symbol or number like this: 

Iatcom5

… where the 5 looks like an s. That part is the root. Then for every system, think up a mnemonic rule like, ‘use the capital first letter, lowercase second letter, and capital first vowel.’ 

Thus, for Google, the root plus your mnemonic rule: 
Iatcom5GoO

For Flickr: 
Iatcom5FlI

For Twitter: 
Iatcom5TwI

… and so on. Do whatever you can do that is easy to remember, but not easy to guess, and different from system to system. It takes a while to change but it is worth doing.
