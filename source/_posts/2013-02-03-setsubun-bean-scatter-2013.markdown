_Today was the setsubun, or the day before the first day of Spring in Japan. It was appropriately fairly warm, and we did the traditional thing. Read on to find out what that is._

See the short YouTube video of the "mame maki" or bean scattering, in which we say "oni wa soto, fuku wa uchi" or devils out, good luck in:

Those are my daughters Ky and Ju. Ky appears only for a second, and then it's Ju doing most of the throwing and chanting. Both of them are in their entrance exam period, and have really put the time and effort in. I hope they both pass and get to go where they want to go. 

In addition to the bean throwing we also eat a number of beans equal to our age, and scarf down a sushi roll without pausing or talking, while facing the south east. 

All in the name of good luck!
