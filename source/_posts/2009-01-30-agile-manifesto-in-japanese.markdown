I wanted to explain the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) to my Japanese colleagues, so I translated it into my (admittedly imperfect) Japanese. Kirara397 was kind enough to suggest some edits to my Japanese in the comments, so I incorporated them. Thanks Kirara! At any rate, have a look:


> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.


プロセスやツールより、各個人の意見や互いのやり取り。


Working software over comprehensive documentation.


完璧な文書化より、動くソフト。


Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.


契約の細かい点より、お客様との腹合わせ。


Responding to change over following a plan.


「計画通り」より、「臨機応変」。


It can easily be applied to non-development teams as well. It's a good guideline for teamwork, I think, and has withstood the test of time.
