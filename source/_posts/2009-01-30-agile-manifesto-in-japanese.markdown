_I wanted to explain the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) to my Japanese colleagues, so I translated it into my (admittedly imperfect) Japanese._ 

<!--more--> 

Kirara397 was kind enough to suggest some edits to my Japanese in the comments, so I incorporated them. Thanks Kirara! At any rate, have a look:

{% blockquote %}
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
プロセスやツールより、各個人の意見や互いのやり取り。

Working software over comprehensive documentation.
完璧な文書化より、動くソフト。

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
契約の細かい点より、お客様との腹合わせ。

Responding to change over following a plan.
「計画通り」より、「臨機応変」。
{% endblockquote %}

It can easily be applied to non-development teams as well. It's a good guideline for teamwork, I think, and has withstood the test of time.
