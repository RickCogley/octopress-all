- [blog:Cogley - Hot Brass, Percussion and Visual - BLAST!](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=714198465066994565)Blast! was born from the Star of Indiana Drum and Bugle Corps, which exited the DCI circuit to form Blast!, a kind of indoor, theatre-based "Brass Theatre" troupe taking the high skills of the best drum corps performers, and performing a kind of greatest hits of drum corps, to thrill audiences everywhere. (Not to mention winning Tony and Emmy awards as well.)The Japan Blast! tour features snare drummer Naoki Ishikawa, who was a champion "individuals" competitive snare player when he marched in DCI, and who is now a featured performer in the Japan Blast! show. He's got incredible chops, and they feature him well during the Battery Battle portion of the show. The video is the percussionists performing during the break between sets, on kitchen stools and a garbage pail. Humorous. :-)The Blast! performers did all the hot drum corps favorites like "Everybody Loves the Blues", "Appalachian Spring", "Medea", and "Malaguena" as well as a number of great numbers that were new to me. Overall, the show was about 2 hours of exciting music and visual performance, which had the audience on their feet by the end.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [blast!](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/blast!), [ishikawa](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/ishikawa), [naoki](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/naoki), [star of indiana](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"star of indiana"), [tokyo](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/tokyo)
