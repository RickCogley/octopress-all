Flickr has [increased their maximum video size](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2009/04/27/hd-video-files-are-big/) from 150 MB to **500 MB** for Pro members. How do these sites handle the continually expanding capacity needs? Flickr charges only 25 dollars per year for pro accounts so they must have scads of users.
