MobileMe iDisk users can share files **Public**ly, but it's _less than obvious_ how to do it. Further, the whole MobileMe experience is still a bit buggy as well, in my experience. Apple announced back in the summer when MobileMe launched, that easy sharing of public files via email would be "coming soon", and their site still reflects that notion. The MobileMe launch was not quite Apple, actually, and felt very poorly handled. Maybe if we're good we'll get a nice MobileMe upgrade Christmas present and be able to share Public file URLs easily via email. That aside, here's how you can do it now: ### How to Share Files via your MobileMe iDisk Public Folder
First, let's assume your MobileMe login name is **awako.kaneyama**@me.com. You would simply connect to your iDisk in OS X or Windows, and copy files you wish to share into the Public folder. Then, tell your friends the URL: > http://idisk.mac.com/**awako.kaneyama**/PublicThey can visit the URL and download the AVIs of junior tearing up the yard. ### But wait, there's a caveat.
I tried this in Flock, which is built using the Firefox 3 engine, and the Public site just stalls out, with a handsome progress spinner, spinning endlessly. It _works fine with Safari_, though. Ironic, no? (Please, Apple, don't become Microsoft.)I hope Apple's MobileMe team will work these bugs out soon, but until then, **Enjoy**!
