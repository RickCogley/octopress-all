I use [TextMate](http://macromates.com) for text editing in OS X and love its clean interface and features, but the defaults do not allow Japanese input and choosing Fonts has been problematic. Never fear. [Hetima san](http://hetima.com/about.php), the developer of [SafariStand](http://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html), released a bundle called [CJKInput](http://hetima.com/textmate/CJKInput20061110.zip) for [TextMate](http://macromates.com) to allow Japanese input, and has a font to boot. I searched a few times for this in English and Japanese, but for some reason never came across it despite its having been around for quite some time. <br /><br />At any rate, you can download [CJKInput](http://hetima.com/textmate/CJKInput20061110.zip), and unzip and copy the tmbundle file into: <br /><br />``~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/PlugIns/``<br /><br />Hetima's Font-Forged, Mono-Space Japanese font **ForMateKonaVe.ttf** is [here](http://hetima.com/temp/ForMateKonaVe2006-11-02.zip), so you can install that in the normal way. Enable it in TextMate Preferences, and away you go. The font is an amalgam of a Japanese font and Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, so it looks good too. <br /><br />
