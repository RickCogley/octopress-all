I occasionally search for design stencils and keep an eye out for them via Google Alerts and so on. Yahoo has a library of stencils available at [Design Stencils - Yahoo! Design Pattern Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/) which has a set available in Visio, Photoshop, Illustrator and [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/) format. For OmniGraffle stencils, there is also [GraffleTopia](http://www.graffletopia.com/). 

If you are not familiar with the concept, design stencils are an illustration that is made available in a design or illustration application, so that you can just quickly drag the illustration from a picker menu, to your drawing canvas. That way, instead of reinventing the wheel and illustrating an office chair every time, you can just drag a stencil in and voil√†! you're done. Makes life easy, and makes you look good.
