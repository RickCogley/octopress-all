_One fun and unique feature of Japanese language is the ease with which you can create easy-to-remember phrases from numbers._ 

<!--more--> 

This is called "[goroawase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_wordplay)", and really does factor into daily life here in Japan. 

For instance - 

* "39" or san-kyuu is thank you, sometimes used in online chat.
* "1192" or iikuni, is the year the Kamakura bakufu government was established, with the idea of making a good country (ii kuni) .
* "4649" or yoroshiku is used when you are asking someone to do something. This uses both readings of the numeral 4, 'yon' and 'shi'.
* "4946" or yokuyomu (often read), is used in toll free phone numbers for newspapers and magazines. Nikkei even has it in their website - [http://www.nikkei4946.com/](http://www.nikkei4946.com/).

If you are learning the language, keep and eye out for goroawase. It makes learning Japanese a lot of fun.
