_One fun and unique feature of Japanese language is the ease with which you can create easy-to-remember phrases from numbers._ 

<!--more--> 

This is called "[goroawase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_wordplay)", and really does factor into daily life here in Japan. 

For instance - 

* "39" or san-kyuu is thank you, sometimes used in online chat.
* "1192" or iikuni, is the year the Kamakura bakufu government was established, with the idea of making a good country (ii kuni) .
* "4649" or yoroshiku is used when you are asking someone to do something. This uses both readings of the numeral 4, 'yon' and 'shi'.
* "4946" or yokuyomu (often read), is used in toll free phone numbers for newspapers and magazines. Nikkei even has it in their website - [http://www.nikkei4946.com/](http://www.nikkei4946.com/).

A friend asked for possibilities for a license plate so I offered these - 

* "3923" thank you, Nissan.
* "4155" yoi, go go!
* "3315" sa, sa, iko!
* "9182" cu(t)ie honey.
* "8251" honey koi!
* "8888" hahahaha! (Lucky Chinese New Year?!)
* "6480" guess it - if you're a dentist.
* "0340" osushi maru! (Love sushi!)
* "0082" ore pa puu! (I'm a knucklehead)

See my [Goroawase Reference Page](/resources/rick-cogley-goroawase-japanese-wordplay/) for more examples.  

###Number-Sound Subtitutions

If you are in Japan and see a sign or advert with kana under numbers, here's a list of possible substitutions you can try, to help you comprehend what is being written. This list includes onyomi (Chinese reading), kunyomi (Japanese reading), and English transliterations for your reference.
