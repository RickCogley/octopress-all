One fun and unique feature of Japanese language is the ease with which you can create easy-to-remember phrases from numbers. I assembled a little database of these "goroawase" mnemonic helpers, for students of Japanese to see. Check out [this page](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/dabble/goroawase.php), and contribute if you can. (Can you guess what 39 is, before you look at the database?)
