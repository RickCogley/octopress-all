[Changing Wiki Server's repository](https://blogs.communication.utexas.edu/groups/techteam/weblog/25a95/Changing_Wiki_Server%27s_Repository.html)


How to change the Apple OS X Leopard Server's Wiki Server's repository location. -- Rick Cogley | From the site: I was able to change where the Wiki Server (the thing responsible for the blog you're looking at) keeps its "repository" (all the files and pages you've added).  Merely use the serveradmin tool:

[Interview with Masato Inoue about Green Design](http://www.greencardesign.co.uk/site/item.php?id=1205331273&category=news&subcat=interviews)


My friend Masato Inoue, Nissan designer, is interviewed about his Pivo. -- Rick Cogley | From the site. March 10. 2008 | Hannah Macmurray. Interview with Masato Inoue. Masato Inoue has been the Chief Designer of Nissan's Exploratory Design Department for about 8 years in Japan. On the surface he doesn’t seem like your run of the mill Japanese businessman, his Italian tailored suit and styled shoes, slightly longer hair than ‘regulation’ allows, but don’t let that fool you. He is 100% Japanese and this makes him proud of his culture, something which most Japanese have grown up to reject because of the shame of WWII. Inoue san has an open eye on whats happening around the world, an open ear to listen what people have to say, and an open heart for Japanese design. He knows what Nissan’s customers want before they even know they want it, and likewise he knew what Nissan needed before management did…an electric car!

Cycling Social Network, iPhone, Topo Maps, Elevation Profiles, GPS Support.](http://www.mapmyride.com)Pretty poorly designed website (so busy, it looks like a Japanese site), but an interesting concept nonetheless. -- Rick Cogley | From the site: Plot your bike rides over mountains (view elevation), through the woods (topo maps), and speeding through the city (street level views) with just a few mouse clicks. Once your cycling map is complete you can quickly view it in 3D, satellite form, or share it with friends.

- [AppleInsider | Japanese "hate" for iPhone all a big mistake](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/02/28/japanese_hate_for_iphone_all_a_big_mistake.html)Balanced article refuting a Wired article about how iPhone in Japan is a failure. Prince McLean quotes my blog in this article as well. -- Rick Cogley | Japanese "hate" for iPhone all a big mistake - By Prince McLeanA report intending to portray the iPhone as "hated" in the Japanese market turns out to have been built upon fake quotations from industry writers and observers who were misrepresented by remarks attributed to them that they never made. Their actual comments on the iPhone's prospects in Japan are far more interesting.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [appleinsider](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/appleinsider), [prince](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/prince), [mclean](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/mclean), [iphone](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/iphone), [rick](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/rick), [cogley](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/cogley)
- [blog:Cogley - Bus tours give insight into Japan PM](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=51728404748781471)A friend mentioned that she understands better "why Japanese are like they are", after having been on a weekend bus tour to Mt. Fuji. I've been on Japanese bus tours before, but it never really dawned on me that they could be a window on the soul of the Japanese, but I suppose they are, in a way. I've always been against them, but occasionally bow to pressure from the higher authorities at my house, like my wife and daughters, and go on a bus tour.

- [blog:Cogley - Guerilla Collaboration](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=165596000265243847)Aaron Fulkerson, the CEO at Mindtouch - makers of the awesome mashable wiki "Deki" - writes about the state of collaboration in his post Three Decades Later. Revolt Or Die.As Aaron mentions, the current state of affairs with regard to collaboration is very much email centric. However, email is terrible for collaboration. If you have never given this much though, sit a moment and really think through what it means to try to manage a project, with file versioning, in email. If you think on it, you can see how easily email can snowball out of hand, with noone on the team knowing what file or which piece of info is the current, latest version.I know this from painful experience. We have had to manage very large projects via email, because of the strong resistance at the client to any web-based applications. People have been adamant: "we use email for everything." Yikes. There are even project management applications that cater (pander?) to this attitude, like Wrike.

- [iPhone in Japan - from a satisfied user | Snap!Japan - a long-term resident's perspective](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=104580635976330167)In general I am satisfied with my iPhone in Japan. This article is a response to an article in Wired, and talks a bit about the iPhone, differences from Japanese cellphones, and what I've felt and heard from Japanese users.
