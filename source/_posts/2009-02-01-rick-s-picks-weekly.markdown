- [iPhone Apps for Designers | CreativePro.com](http://www.creativepro.com/article/iphone-apps-designers)A good bunch of design-related iPhone Apps related to color, fonts or time tracking. --Rick CogleyFrom the site - For designers, the iPhone (and the iPod touch, which runs the same software but doesn’t include phone functions) is turning into a valuable sidekick. Amid the games, utilities, games, novelty programs, and, yes, games on Apple’s App Store are lots of apps geared toward designers. Here are several that stand out. (Note that URLs in some cases lead directly to the App Store within iTunes.)[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [creativepro](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/creativepro), [iphone](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/iphone), [designer](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/designer)

[iPlotz: wireframing, mockups and prototyping for websites and applications](http://www.iplotz.com/whatisiPlotz.php)


App wireframing webapp. Cool. Kind of like balsamiq.With iPlotz you can create clickable, navigable wireframes to create the experience of a real website or software application. You can also invite others to comment on the designs, and once ready, you can then manage the tasks for developers and designers to build the project.

- [Circos - visualize genomes and genomic data](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/)WOW, this is a cool tool. Circos is designed with genome data in mind but can be used for visualization of any data sets. --Rick CogleyFrom the site: Circos is designed for visualizing genomic data such as alignments, conservation, and generalized 2D data, such as line, scatter, heatmap and histogram plots. Circos is very flexible — you can use it to visualize any kind of data, not just genomics. Circos has been used to visualize customer flow in the auto industry, volume of courier shipments, database schemas, and presidential debates.The creation of Circos was motivated by a need to visualize intra- and inter-chromosomal relationships within one or more genomes, or between any two or more sets of objects with a corresponding distance scale. Circos is similar to chromowheel and, to a lesser extent, genopix.

- [Planning Poker](http://www.planningpoker.com/)Effective estimation method. From the site - How does Planning Poker® work? ... The idea behind Planning Poker is simple. Individual stories are presented for estimation. After a period of discussion, each participant chooses from his own deck the numbered card that represents his estimate of how much work is involved in the story under discussion. All estimates are kept private until each participant has chosen a card. At that time, all estimates are revealed and discussion can begin again.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [agile](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/agile), [poker](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/poker), [tools](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/tools), [projectmanagement](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/projectmanagement), [scrum](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/scrum)

- [Vasco Duarte's Personal Scrum](http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.blogspot.com/2008/04/personal-scrum-or-work-20.html)Vasco Duarte is using a "personal scrum" to manage and "eat his own dog food" so to speak. He says - I'm using Scrum patterns for managing my own work. Let me explain this a little bit. I'm following a method for the management of my personal work that resembles and is largely based on the patterns that we see in Scrum.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [scrum](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/scrum), [personal scrum](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"personal scrum"), [vasco duarte](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"vasco duarte")
