The creatures called "gyaru" (teenage girls who hang out in the youth spots in Tokyo) have their own slang language that morphs rapidly. Nobody, even them, can keep up with it. Morning TV had a special segment about the latest "gyaru-go" language trends, which I thought were worth sharing:


### "Itsumen" - いつメン



From itsumo-no-menbaa いつものメンバー. The usual group we hang out with.


### "kamacho" - かまちょ



From kamatte-choudai 構って頂戴. Pay attention to me.




Said to boyfriend who is studiously ignoring your commentary.


### tkmr - タカマル？



Takamaru 高まる, meaning, wanna party? Wanna go crazy? Or: are you excited?




I could be down with some tkmr. Itsumen? Kamacho!


### あげモーション



Agemotion. Apparently this is more excited than merely tkmr.




So, it's a nuance thing. tkmr < agemotion.


### ピー逃げ



Pii-nige. To touch your RFID school ID on the attendance sensor in the classroom, then beat a hasty retreat.




Cutting class was never so scientific!


### オコなう



Oko-nau. 怒っているなう。She's upset or angry. Now I'm angry (okotteiru).




N.b: Nau is used in twitter language in Japan, to say where you are now, and uiru (will) is used to say you will.




At home now. Work will. Kind of Yoda-like, if you ask me. Just be forewarned: if you engage in pii-nige, your teacher will be okonau, I tell ya.


### ロールキャベージ



Roll-cabbage. Used to describe a guy who is a vegetable eater on the outside (nice, sweet & pliant to her wishes), but a meat eater on the inside (a take-charge type).




Roll-cabbages can give you gas so be careful, ladies.


### メンタル



Mental. Means she's depressed, feeling blue.




Kind of how I feel now when I try understanding teenage girls!




Now you can visit Shibuya or Harajuku armed with some understanding. Until the language morphs again!
