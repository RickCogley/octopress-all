_The creatures called "gyaru" (teenage girls who hang out in the youth spots in Tokyo) have their own slang language that morphs rapidly. Nobody, even them, can keep up with it. Morning TV had a special segment about the latest "gyaru-go" language trends, which I thought were worth sharing here._

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"Itsumen" - いつメン</div>{% endraw %}

From itsumo-no-menbaa いつものメンバー. The usual group we hang out with.

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"kamacho" - かまちょ</div>{% endraw %}

From kamatte-choudai 構って頂戴. Pay attention to me. Said to boyfriend who is studiously ignoring your commentary.

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"tkmr" - タカマル？</div>{% endraw %}

Takamaru 高まる, meaning, wanna party? Wanna go crazy? Or: are you excited?

I could be down with some tkmr. Itsumen? Kamacho!

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"Agemotion" - あげモーション</div>{% endraw %}

Apparently this is more excited than merely tkmr. So, it's a nuance thing. tkmr < agemotion.

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"Pii-nige" - ピー逃げ</div>{% endraw %}

To touch your RFID school ID on the attendance sensor in the classroom, then beat a hasty retreat. Cutting class was never so scientific!

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"Oko-nau" - オコなう</div>{% endraw %}

She's upset or angry. Now I'm angry (okotteiru).

N.b: Nau is used in twitter language in Japan, to say where you are now, and uiru (will) is used to say you will. Home now. Work will. Kind of Yoda-like, if you ask me. Just be forewarned: if you engage in pii-nige, your teacher will be okonau, I tell ya.

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"Roll-cabbage" - ロールキャベージ</div>{% endraw %}

Used to describe a guy who is a vegetable eater on the outside (nice, sweet & pliant to her wishes), but a meat eater on the inside (a take-charge type).

Roll-cabbages can give you gas so be careful, ladies.

{% raw %}<div class="alert alert-success">"Mental" - メンタル</div>{% endraw %}

Mental. Means she's depressed, feeling blue.

Kind of how I feel now when I try understanding teenage girls! Now you can visit Shibuya or Harajuku armed with some understanding. Until the language morphs again!
