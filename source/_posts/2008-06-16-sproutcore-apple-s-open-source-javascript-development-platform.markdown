If the new desktop-like apps in [MobileMe](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/06/09/apple_introduces_mobileme_push_internet_service.html), Apple's replacement for its .mac service, are any indication, [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) is going to be the source of some really incredible apps.
