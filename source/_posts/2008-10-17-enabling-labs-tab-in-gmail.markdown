If you would like to use some of the Google Labs features in Gmail but cannot find the Labs tab, you can enable it by visiting the following URL after you log in: 


[https://mail.google.com/mail/?labs=1#settings/labs](https://mail.google.com/mail/?labs=1#settings/labs)


Now you can just click the Labs tab and start selecting the Labs features you want, like "[Advanced IMAP Controls](/articles/2008/10/12/save-local-disk-with-gmail-advanced-imap-controls/)" to avoid downloading the entire All Mail folder. Gmail will remember you want the Labs tab for next time.
