Yodobashi Camera has a nice wifi access plan called [Wireless Gate](http://www.tripletgate.com/wirelessgate/), with 6000+ access points across Japan for _380 yen per month_ according to the pamphlet I have. **Wireless Gate** looks like a good plan, and here's how you can sign up (but in Japanese, so get some help from a friend if you're kanji-impaired): - Visit the Wireless Gate [Website](http://www.tripletgate.com/wirelessgate/)
- Email [info@wi-gate.net](mailto:info@wi-gate.net)
- Call toll free 0120-779978
In the pamphlet I got at Yodobashi Camera Shinjuku, they advertise it as working with the iPhone too, so if you do not have the all-you-can-eat plan from Softbank, this might be of help. <br />
