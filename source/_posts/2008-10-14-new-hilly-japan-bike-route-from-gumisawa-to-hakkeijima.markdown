[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/2907498864 "View 'Cycle Fitness 2008' on Flickr.com")Saturday 11 Oct [I rode](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/cogley-cycling-training-log.php) a new 40 km route, this time going East from the mother ship towards Hakkeijima. I went up kanjo 3 go, towards my elder daughter's school, and over to CostCo for some bagels and granola, but it was much harder than I thought, with a 4 km hill right out of the gate. A good difference from the usual "almost no hills" route. Hill-riding is really a different skillset, and is tiring in a different way from my 63 km route down to Enoshima, along the coast, and up via the Sagami and Mekujiri rivers.Check out my other [bike routes](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/cogley-bicycle-routes.php) in Japan, as there are some really nice places to ride here in Kanagawa and Shonan.
