I have liked the iPhone since I started using it when it first came out. I know I can (as a technologist) control Android more with customization. But I don't have time to tinker so it's iPhone for me.

Some of my engineering staff use android, and the impression I get is that it's a fragmented OS, a la Linux. So that right there tells you something about the nature of android.

My 74 yr old mom has a new iPod touch and is cranking away on it. She'd have trouble if it were any more technical. "It just works" comes to mind.

New version, gremlins on old?
