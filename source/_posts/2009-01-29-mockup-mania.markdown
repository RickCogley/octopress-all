[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3234719887 "View 'Balsamiq Mockup for Teamwork Work Management' on Flickr.com")If you do mockups of software interfaces, you might find this post of interest. Although I can write shell scripts and simple perl or ruby scripts well, I am not a developer. However, participating in a session with Pietro, a senior developer of the _work management application_ "**Teamwork**" from Open Labs, I found the Balsamiq application refreshingly easy to use. I was able to open Pietro's Balsamiq file, add a few things, and submit it back to him for his comments. This exchange prompted me to see what kind of mockup applications were out there, despite of course being able to do mockups in Visio or Omni Graffle. 


### Selected Mockup Applications



Here's what I found, briefly: 


[Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups/tour) is a cross-platform Java app that will run on your Windows, Mac or Linux machine, and which is focused on integration into wikis like XWiki or Confluence. **Balsamiq** mockups look like drawings, so your customers won't get confused and think the software is going to be "done soon". 


[iPlotz](http://www.iplotz.com/whatisiPlotz.php) is a cross-platform Flash app, with collaboration features. **iPlotz** mocks are more even sketch-like than those made in Balsamiq, and the collaboration part is a nice bonus.  


[Mockup Screens](http://mockupscreens.com/index.php?page=Screen-Prototypes) is a Windows only app, so if you are in a shop that does Windows only, **Mockup Screens** might work for you. Personally, I prefer multi-platform, cross-platform everything. 


[DabbleBoard](http://www.dabbleboard.com/tour) is a general-purpose drawing app that has collaboration, but could probably be used for mockups as well. **DabbleBoard** not purpose built, though, but still is intriguing. 


[Axure](http://axure.com/tour.aspx) is also Windows only, but appears to have some very advanced features to allow fully-functional interactive mockups with collaboration. **Axure** is a bit more expensive compared to the other listed solutions, but seems to be pretty comprehensive. Thanks to Enda in the comments for the tip!


That's all for now but let me know if there is anything else out there. Enjoy!
