[Grenning's Planning Poker](http://www.planningpoker.com/detail.html)


Very useful article on estimation. On Grenning's "Planning Poker". From the site: The best way I’ve found for agile teams to estimate is by playing planning poker (Grenning 2002). Planning poker combines expert opinion, analogy, and disaggregation into an enjoyable approach to estimating that results in quick but reliable estimates.

[Does Agile Development Work for Systems Integration? « SmoothSpan Blog](http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2008/09/15/does-agile-development-work-for-sytems-integration)


Can Agile be applied to systems integration projects? Yes and no. --Rick CogleyFrom the site: Agile is not for everyone or every project.  There are some requirements for it to be successful that fly in the face of a lot of the established norms for IT projects and implementations.  That’s not to say you couldn’t use Agile for such projects, but unless everyone involved clearly understood the Agile requirements, it would not likely be an unsuccessful attempt.What are these requirements?

[Scrum works, even for non-development GIS projects | EdgeHopper](http://edgehopper.com/scrum-works-even-for-non-development-gis-projects)


Some thoughts on using AGILE / SCRUM techniques for non-development projects. -- Rick CogleyFrom the site: The other night, I was at a get together of some regional ArcGIS developers. They asked about Scrum and we started talking about the requirement that every iteration must produce some potentially shippable product increment. Being GIS folks, someone asked how you would apply that “rule” to non-development GIS projects. It made me sit back and think for a bit. So, out of curiosity, and to find out if anyone out there used an Agile approach to these types of projects, I searched Google using several appropriate search phrases. To my astonishment, I couldn’t find a single reference to anyone using Agile methods for non-development GIS Projects. In fact, most led me to very rigid, stepwise, waterfall approaches to GIS project management.

[Top Web Project Management, Vertabase Pricing](http://www.vertabase.com/pricing.html)


Vertabase is a solid-looking online or self-hosted PM solution. No invoicing, but it seems to cover the basics. Could not find the way to change currency to Yen or to get it to allow Japanese characters to be saved, as the demo "munges" them into ??? marks.

[Official Google Mobile Blog: Ring in the New Year with Bells and Whistles](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/01/ring-in-new-year-with-bells-and.html)


If you use Google Mobile for iPhone, go to its settings and keep trying to scroll down past About. You get a little easter egg reward in the form of a "bells and whistles" menu. Nice! -- Rick CogleyFrom the blog: One evening in Zurich, after a late night cake run, we decided that our iPhone app, Google Mobile App with Voice Search, could do with a little bling. The result of this is a few extra options hidden below the preferences on the Settings tab. Trust us, they're down there... it just might take some perseverance to get to the bottom of things. Just keep trying!
