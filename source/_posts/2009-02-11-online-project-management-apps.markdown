Many people on Twitter ask for recommendations for a good online project management solution. There are many such web-based applications out there, and it really depends upon your needs and intended project approach - are you "agile", do you want to use "scrum" or "kanban", or are you PMI all the way. Do you want it SaaS, or self-hosted? Do you need time tracking? Should a wiki be integrated? The list goes on. My requirements to make it through the "first cut" were:





app is web-based and so is accessible anywhere.


app is relatively bug free and stable.


app developer has some history and do not look like they will disappear tomorrow.


app is not linked to a single platform (that is, it can be accessed from a PC, Mac or Linux system, for instance) or a single technology (for instance, that it "requires IE and ActiveX").


app supports Japanese for data entry, export to CSV or other formats, and in reports (I did not need the UI to be Japanese, necessarily, but the input and output should support Japanese characters). 


app has time tracking.


app has custom fields, especially for time tracking.


app has email integration preferably in- and out-bound.


app has acceptable reporting.





Just below is a list that basically supported the above, or I felt were interesting enough to look at in more detail, even if the app did not make the cut - for example, "it must be free" or "it must include invoicing". I suggest you make a list like that to weed out the ones that won't work for you. Then you can start concentrating on really fine-grained items like: 





app allows entry of "time remaining" rather than the asinine practice of entering percent complete.


app allows entry of estimates, from a task, rate-type, or "phase" perspective, and a printout of those (because even agile teams have stakeholders).


app is not just a list, but has some level of workflow tracking built in as well.


app does not lock you into only one way of doing things, but rather allows you to approach things from your perspective.

### Other Online PM Solutions



There are many other ones that I looked at, but were not quite what I wanted or needed. This does not mean they won't work for you or are inherently bad. For your reference, here's a list of some of the others (in alphabetical order) that I thought were good but that either lacked something I needed or that I simply did not have time to assess properly: 





**[5pm](http://www.5pmweb.com)** from QG Software

**Note**, many of these apps have _ways to get a free version_ (limited by number of users or projects for example), are free for open source teams, or, are open source to begin with. I hope this article can be a starting point for your search for the perfect PM app. **Enjoy!**
