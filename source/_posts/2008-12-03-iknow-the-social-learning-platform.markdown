    -     [iKnow! - The Social Learning Platform. - iKnow!](http://www.iknow.co.jp)    iKnow is an interesting site for learning language. They call themselves a "social learning platform" which I think is a unique concept, and right now the learning content is English and Japanese courses. The site seems modern, with typical "social networking" features. If you are used to linked.in, delicious, facebook, mixi, you'll feel at home.
