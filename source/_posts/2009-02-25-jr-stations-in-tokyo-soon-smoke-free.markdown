JR Stations are to be Smoke-free Zones as of April 1st 2009. This poster on the platform at Shinjuku station says: > ### All Stations in Tokyo will be Completely Smoke Free from 1st April
JR East has always had separate zones for smoking and non-smoking, but due to many customers requesting protection from second-hand smoke, and increased drives at companies to discourage smoking, from 1st April the smoking areas on platforms in Tokyo will be removed, and we will begin to implement a "Total No-Smoking" policy. This will be inconvenient for customers who smoke, but we wish to sincerely ask for your understanding and cooperation in this matter.  And I look forward to breathing fresher air on the platforms.
