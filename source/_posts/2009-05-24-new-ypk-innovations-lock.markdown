[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3558591254 "View 'New YPK Innovations Lock - Cafe 2.0' on Flickr.com")I got a new bike lock from **[YPK Innovations](http://www.ypkinnovations.com)** - a [Cafe 2.0](http://www.ypkinnovations.com/Cafe_2.0.html). The model I bought has a more flexible and just slightly lighter cable than the last, as well as much harder, more durable-seeming plastic around the lock. I like it better. 


There were two problems with the old one, that cropped up after 18 months of daily, outdoor use at the train station: 





The plastic bezel around the lock broke, exposing the metal lock.


The metal collar inside, around the lock itself started to rotate, covering up the hole that the post was supposed to be inserted into.





Here are photos of the problem:

I think the one I just bought is a generation old, but it still seems better than the first one. These YPK "cafe" locks are nice because you can make two loops for flexible locking.
