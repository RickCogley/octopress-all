[{% img right http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1342/4607222093_0f8411bd55_m.jpg '' 'Voigtländer Color-Skopar 20mm Lens Cap Challenge' %}](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/4607222093 "View 'Voigtländer Color-Skopar 20mm Lens Cap Challenge' on Flickr.com")The lens cap that comes supplied with the _Voigtländer Color-Skopar 20mm SL II_ does not fit, when you have the LH-20 lens hood and a filter on. What a dumb design oversight. However, if you get a Nikon LC-52 52mm lens cap, that fits right in there, no problem. Nice. 




I like the design of the Nikon caps better than the Cosina Voigtländer or Carl Zeiss ones anyway. Easy to grab and avoid getting my paw prints all over the lens. 




I hope this helps any owners of the tiny high-performance Voigtländer Color-Skopar 20mm SL II. **Enjoy**!
