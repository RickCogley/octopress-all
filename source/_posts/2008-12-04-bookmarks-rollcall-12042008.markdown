- [AppZapper - The uninstaller Apple forgot. Uninstall Awesomeness.](http://www.appzapper.com/)I love this app. It makes such a pleasing zap sound when zapping an app, and it works well, too. You need this if you trial software a lot, and end up uninstalling. From the App Zapper site - "Introducing AppZapper. AppZapper is for people who want to confidently try new apps while knowing they can uninstall them easily. Drag one or more unwanted apps onto AppZapper and watch as it finds all the extra files and lets you delete them with a single click. A slick safety system remembers which apps you want to keep safe, and the log tracks all the files you've zapped. In one Zap you'll understand it. In two you'll fall in love. Within the five free Zaps, you'll know you need to add AppZapper to your arsenal. Go ahead  -  try five free zaps and see AppZapper, the Mac uninstaller for the rest of us, in action.
