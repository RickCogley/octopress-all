When systems engineers are just beginning to learn, or are faced with a situation of having to change from one OS to another, it is good to have a comparison of commands or methods to ease the transition. Thinking of one such situation, I put together [Linux and DOS Command Line Equivalents](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/../goodies/reference/linux-dos-command-equivalents.php "Linux vs DOS"), and hope it is useful for some. <br /><br />The technology behind the page is interesting, and it's such a pleasure to have tools like this. The page uses a Google Spreadsheet as its data source, and the GTable macro from [Loghound's](http://www.loghound.com) PlusKit. In a styled text page in RapidWeaver, I inserted commands like the following (without the space between @ and gtable): <br /><br /><span style="font:12px Courier, mono; ">@ gtable((pRjiYF5QI6j4rHxaJXP7rRQ, id:sysadmintable1, theme:lab-report, header:true, search:section="Entering Commands",ignore:section))<br /></span><br />This feeds the ID of the Google Spreadsheet and other query parameters to the Google Docs API, and several of these commands resulted in the nicely-formatted page within the confines of my site. The best thing is, when I update the Google Spreadsheet, my site's page updates automatically. <br /><br />The page itself is admittedly imperfect, but it is a start. Hope you enjoy it.
