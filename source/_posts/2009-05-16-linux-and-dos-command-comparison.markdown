When systems engineers are just beginning to learn, or are faced with a situation of having to change from one OS to another, it is good to have a comparison of commands or methods to ease the transition. I have a starting point for you, if you are in that situation.

Thinking of one such situation, I put together [Linux and DOS Command Line Equivalents](/resources/rick-cogley-command-line-equivalents/ "Linux vs DOS"). This page is pulling its information from a database table in eSolia's online database service [PROdb](http://www.esolia.com/prodb). Hope you enjoy it!
