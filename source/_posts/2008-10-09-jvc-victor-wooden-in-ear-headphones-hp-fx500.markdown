[<img class="right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3105/2838312426_285c326bec_m.jpg" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/2838312426 "View 'JVC Victor HP-FX500 In-ear Headphones' on Flickr.com")When my iPod's basic headphones died, I bought the wooden JVC Victor HP-FX500 model earphones for about JPY 15,000. These have a wooden trembler, and so the sound is very natural. If you like to listen to anything acoustic, jazz, classical, opera and so forth, these are great 'phones. They have 100dB/1mW sensitivity and 8Hz to 25kHz frequency response. If you have never used an in-ear 'phone before, they take a bit of getting used to, as they shut out pretty much all sound. It's a little disconcerting to be able to hear your own heartbeat, but they sound wonderful.<br /><br />
