[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickcogley/2977695943/ "photo sharing")There are these huge pillars being built near Totsuka station, on the Hitachi Software side of the main road, and these struck me as being an interesting photo. The 40 km speed limit seems to apply to the slow pace of the construction!
