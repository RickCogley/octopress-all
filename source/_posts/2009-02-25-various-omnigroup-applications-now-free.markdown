**From "The Omni Mouth"**, [Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/)'s blog, OmniWeb, OmniDazzle, OmniDiskSweeper, and OmniObjectMeter are [_now freeware_](http://blog.omnigroup.com/2009/02/25/omniweb-omnidazzle-omnidisksweeper-and-omniobjectmeter-now-freeware/). This decision is relayed in Omni Group's usual light, irreverent manner, but it's a big one, in my opinion. Software development is hard work and requires a lot of investment, so I'm grateful Omni Group decided to make these fine programs available for free. 


If you are on a Mac, and have never checked them out, take a test drive of [Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/)'s very high quality commercial offerings, like OmniGraffle, OmniOutline, OmniPlan or OmniFocus. I use these regularly. They're worth it, so go buy some.
