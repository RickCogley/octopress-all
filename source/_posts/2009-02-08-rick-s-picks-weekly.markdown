- [Article from Rick Cogley - The Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/rick-cogley-on-agile-principles.php)Looking at the basics of Agile in more detail to help me apply it to general, non-development project management, the principles behind the Agile Manifesto are readily available for us to read and learn from. -- Rick Cogley[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [rickcogley](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/rickcogley), [rick cogley](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"rick cogley"), [agile](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/agile), [principles](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/principles)
- [blog:Cogley - Agile Principles, Translated, with Some Commentary](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=25519211953049763)To help my Japanese colleagues understand the concepts of Agile more easily, after the jump, I'll translate the principles into Japanese, under the original English from the Agile website. The Japanese translations and any mistakes therein are solely my responsibility. Further, I'll take the opportunity to comment on what I see as important in the principles. For instance, do the principles allow for or even demand a lazy, free-for-all approach? Can an inexperienced team do Agile effectively, or, is mentoring needed?

- [Pomodoro Technique for "Personal Scrum"](http://www.tecnicadelpomodoro.it/tdp.html)The "pomodoro technique" is a sort of "personal scrum" technique for getting things done. Check out the paper written in English on this page - it's a link to a PDF. --Rick CogleyFrom the site, in Italian - Abstract - Per molte persone il tempo rappresenta un nemico. L'ansia relativa al "tempo che passa", soprattutto in presenza di scadenze, genera comportamenti non efficaci nel lavoro e nello studio e, per questa via, sviluppa la tendenza a procrastinare.

- [blog:Cogley - Online Project Management Solutions](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=2608523158900965833)Many people on Twitter ask for recommendations for a good online project management solution. There are many such web-based applications out there, and it really depends upon your needs and intended project approach - are you "agile", do you want to use "scrum" or "kanban", or are you PMI all the way. Do you want it SaaS, or self-hosted? Do you need time tracking? Should a wiki be integrated? The list goes on. My requirements to make it through the "first cut" are listed in the article.
