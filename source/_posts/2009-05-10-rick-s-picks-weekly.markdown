[Building a URL Shortener](http://snook.ca/archives/php/url-shortener)


From the site: With all the talk of URL shortening services, I decided to add a quick service into Snook.ca, which is run on CakePHP, to redirect a short URL to a post. Because my static content already has short URLs and all I have are posts, creating a short URL handler for it was very easy.

- [Build Your Own Url Shortener For Free! | NetHackz](http://nethackz.com/build-your-own-url-shortener-for-free)From the site: Build Your Own Url Shortener For Free! - URL shorteners are awesome.  The less characters, the better!  But what happens when that server goes down or some network issue prevents people from getting to your links?Nothing.  Blank pages.Better yet, why would you want to brand someone elses domain name?  Think about all the traffic and notoriety youâ€™re giving tinyurl and is.gd?  Can you use that same traffic to your advantage?[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [url shortener](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/"url shortener")
