I just discovered that you can upload files to Google Docs via email. Get your special email address at this URL when you are logged into your Google account: 


[http://docs.google.com/?action=updoc](http://docs.google.com/?action=updoc)


There are some limitations as to what you can upload, both from a document type and size standpoint, but this feature sounds useful to me.
