The Nikon point-and-shoot [COOLPIX P6000](http://www.nikon.com/about/news/2008/0807_coolpixp6000_01.htm) was released in Japan today and I checked it out at the Shinjuku Yodobashi Camera.

I'll have to find some samples of its RAW output and download them, to see if I can process the files in Aperture. There are a lot of disclaimers about the NRW format RAW files: Windows-only this, in-camera-only that, so we shall see. 

I bet we'll see this kind of in-camera GPS become more and more prevalent.
