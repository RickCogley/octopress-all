Good solid feel to the camera's construction despite a light weight, but it's the features that are a draw: built-in GPS for Geotagging, and the ability to shoot in RAW are my favorites. <br /><br />I'll have to find some samples of its RAW output and download them, to see if I can process the files in Aperture. There are a lot of disclaimers about the NRW format RAW files: Windows-only this, in-camera-only that, so we shall see. <br /><br />I bet we'll see this kind of in-camera GPS become more and more prevelant.<br /><br />
