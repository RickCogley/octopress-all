[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/2978501810 "View 'Around Totsuka Yokohama 2008' on Flickr.com")**The thought** that _"no correctly-spec'ed project gets approved"_ leads me to lots of questions, and no real answers this morning. 


I was thinking about the massive projects that the world has seen, like the Pyramids, great Dams, Bridges, Skyscrapers and Railways, or well-designed and -architected cities in general, and wondering: Are these things we marvel at, _built on_ great inequities? Inequities that people of certain demographics cannot even imagine (thinking about myself as a white, male, middle-class American). 


It's not comfortable to think about, but would such marvels even exist if there were not the exploited and the exploiters? Can this said to have been even _necessary_ for technical progress? 


Food for thought.
