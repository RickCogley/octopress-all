_I just noticed that **Eurobiz Japan** inanely published my article on _Interim IT Management Services_ in their May 2010 issue under the name "Rick R. Colgey". Aw, come on!_

The Eurobiz editors took the time to painstakingly "correct" my American spelling during proofreading, then got my name wildly incorrect in the article. Thanks a bunch, folks. `</sarcasm>`
