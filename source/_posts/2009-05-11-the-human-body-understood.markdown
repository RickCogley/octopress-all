A random and very funny list circulating 'round the Internets. Understand your own body. 


{% blockquote %}

### The Human Body


It takes your food **seven seconds** to get from your mouth to your stomach.


One human hair can **support 3 kg** (6.6 lb).


The average man's penis is **three times the length** of his thumb.


Human thighbones are **stronger than** concrete.


A woman's heart **beats faster** than a man's.


There are about one **trillion** bacteria on each of your feet.


Women **blink** twice as often as men.


The average person's skin **weighs twice as much** as the brain.


Your body uses **300 muscles to balance** itself when you are standing still.


**If saliva** cannot dissolve something, you cannot taste it.


Women reading this **will be finished** now.


Men are still busy **checking their thumbs**.

Lol.
