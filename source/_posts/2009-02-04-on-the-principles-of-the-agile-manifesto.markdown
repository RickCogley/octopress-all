Looking at the basics of Agile in more detail over the last weeks, to help me apply it and other philosophies and methods to general, non-development project management, I discovered that the [principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) behind the [Agile Manifesto](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=3737982440893156726) are readily available. 


## Agile Principles, Translated, with Some Commentary



To help my Japanese colleagues understand the concepts of Agile more easily, after the jump, I'll translate the principles into Japanese, under the original English from the Agile website. The Japanese translations and any mistakes therein are solely my responsibility. Further, I'll take the opportunity to comment on what I see as important in the principles. For instance, do the principles allow for or even demand a lazy, free-for-all approach? Can an inexperienced team do Agile effectively, or, is mentoring needed? 


Please have a look at the [short article](http://rick.cogley.info/goodies/reference/rick-cogley-on-agile-principles.php) and commentary. Put your comments on this blog post; I'd love to hear from you, and I hope this article helps someone. **Enjoy**!
