I [wrote yesterday](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=5366947200020189062) about the furor over the new **Facebook** Terms of Service statement, but Facebook has gone and reverted to their old terms while they figger out which end is up. I can't even access the Facebook blog, so forget an URL, but here's what the top page says: > ### Terms of Use Update
A couple of weeks ago, we posted an update to our Terms of Use that we hoped would clarify some parts of it for our users. Over the past couple of days, we have received a lot of questions and comments about these updated terms and what they mean for people and their information. Because of the feedback we received, we have decided to return to our previous Terms of Use while we resolve the issues that people have raised. For more information, visit the Facebook Blog.We'll see what happens. I think FB should charge something for their service. Why do people assume bandwidth and hardware is free anyway?
