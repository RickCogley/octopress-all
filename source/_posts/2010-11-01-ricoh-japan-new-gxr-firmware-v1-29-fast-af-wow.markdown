Ricoh Japan just released the new GXR firmware, version 1.29,Â [on their Japan site](http://www.ricoh.co.jp/dc/download/gxr.html), and the _autofocus speed is now really, really fast_. Everyone who has a Ricoh GXR with A12 50mm module should definitely update right away. Fantastic improvement and thanks Ricoh!
