[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3259442344 "View 'Eiken 3rd Level, First Half Pass' on Flickr.com")My daughter Kylie passed the first half of her 3rd level English-as-a-second-language test, the "[Eiken](http://www.stepeiken.org/)" from Step. The numbering system is typically Japanese, where the testees start on the basic level 5, and proceed up to level 1 with a few sub-levels in between. She now has to pass the interview portion to get the certificate, so we plan to practice with her.
