- [Snap!Japan - Tokyo Metro Manners Posters](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=267518165908747805)Artist Bunpei Yorifuji (寄藤文平) is creating a series of manner posters for the Tokyo metro, around the theme of "Do It At Home". Yorifuji was born in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, in 1973, and founded Bunpei Ginza in 2000 to specialize in mainly Art Direction, Illustration and Book Design.Yorifuji's manners posters address the most common complaints heard by the Metro, such as people who apply makeup, party, sit on the floor, take up too much room, jump through the closing doors at the last minute, wear Everest-assault-sized backbacks and so on. I have to chuckle at the rather awkward and sometimes double-entendre Engrish, but that's what gives them charm, I suppose. I even found a spoof poster. See the thumbs below for the spoof poster and the official website.

- [ISM Adamo Saddles](http://www.t1bicycles.com/t1bicycles.com/ISM_Adamo_Saddles.html)Sounds good, if it will eliminate the numbness.  - Rick Cogley || From the site: What is an ISM saddle? - The original ISM saddle was designed to create a seat that would eliminate, or at least reduce, the discomfort most riders experience on a traditional bike saddle. The concept was patented by 1999. In 2008 alone, ISM has seen success with 11 Ironman wins, 2 Olympic silver medals, 1 World Duathlon Championship, 1 Lifetime Fitness Series overall win, and countless age group victories. Pros and amateurs alike are finding riding and competing comfortable again.Why is an ISM saddle so comfortable?Our patented saddles are unisex and remove pressure off the pudendal nerve and arteries in both male and female riders for un-paralleled comfort.Click here for more information: FAQ ISM.doc Click here for set up instructions: adamo_setup.pdf Ready to order a saddle? Email us at : info@t1bicycles.comshapeimage_2_link_0shapeimage_2_link_1shapeimage_2_link_2Race Saddle JPY 19,000Peloton Saddle JPY 14,000Medical Information:On an annual basis, bicycle riding involves several hundred million people worldwide. Studies have linked perineal pressure caused by straddling traditional bicycle seats to numbness, urinary tract and yeast infections, prostate inflammation and impotence. For male riders, in addition to the discomfort and numbness associated with a traditional saddle, there is an increased susceptibility to restricted blood flow, which can lead to arterial occlusion and permanent erectile dysfunction. For women, the restricted blood flow and hardening of the genital arteries can lead to an inability to reach orgasm. It has been found that as little as 11% of a person's body weight can compress the genital artery!IN 2004, Dr. Frank Sommer at the University of Cologne tested the ISM saddle.  Dr. Sommer is a noted expert in the area of arterial occlusion resulting from bicycle saddles.[tags](http://www.diigo.com/cloud/rickcogley): [ISM](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/ISM), [Adamo](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/Adamo), [Saddles](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/Saddles), [t1bicycles](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/t1bicycles), [roppongi](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/roppongi), [perineal](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/perineal), [pressure](http://www.diigo.com/user/rickcogley/pressure)
- [Snap!Japan - Ray-Out's iPhone "Jacket" Case Review and DIY Fix](http://rick.cogley.info/snapjapan/index.php?id=2751482896954571463)I purchased Ray-Out's reasonably-priced leather "Jacket" case, model RT-P1LC4/B, perhaps three months ago from Yodobashi Camera. I was looking for a case that had a "strap loop" so that I could hang the iPhone around my neck for going to meetings or lunch, as I don't trust myself to put the iPhone in my pocket and have it survive even one day! The Ray-Out leather jacket was one option, and the other was so bling-bling it wasn't even a choice for me.DIY Fix for the RT-P1LC4/B Loop ProblemUnfortunately, the D-ring that came attached to the case by a leather loop came off, sending the iPhone plummeting to the ground. At least the case's leather hit the ground instead of the actual phone, so my iPhone still works. Ray-Out should re-design that little loop for the D-Ring, because after even a couple month's of use, it became weak and ripped.

[Nikon D90 | How To Use D-MOVIE](http://chsvimg.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/d90/en/d-movie)


A tutorial video from Nikon on the D90's video capability.  - Rick Cogley || From the site: A new idea for D-SLRs, the D90 offers a movie function, allowing you to shoot movies in three different motion JPEG formats: 320 x 216 pixels, 640 x 424 pixels and 1,280 x 720 pixels. Now you can capture life's moving moments with added drama by using many of Nikon's NIKKOR lenses, including the AF DX Fisheye 10.5mm f/2.8G ED and the Micro-NIKKOR lenses. The shallow depth of field can give your movies a more creative and emotional impact. An additional benefit is the D90 image sensor, which is much larger than a typical camcorder for higher image quality and exceptional high ISO performance during low-light shooting.

- [blog:Cogley - iPhone OS 3.0 Tips on Parade](http://rick.cogley.info/blog/index.php?id=8350240585260899429)Apple released yesterday an updated iPhone operating system, iPhone OS 3.0, with a number of useful improvements. For me, the update itself was seamless, and took about 15 minutes after clicking the update button in iTunes. I upgraded first thing in the morning, but colleagues who tried later in the day had some delays. I guess it's to be expected when so many people try to download at the same time.Some Tips for iPhone OS 3.0I took some screenshots of the obvious and not-so-obvious (by pressing the home and power buttons simultaneously in case you aren't aware how), so I'll introduce those to you now.

[Chuck Dillon's blog 30 x 30: Which Student are You?](http://blog30x30.blogspot.com/2009/06/which-student-are-you.html)


Chuck Dillon posts some prescient and hysterical drawings of the 16 breeds of art student.  - Rick Cogley || From the site: I know 10 years is not a long time, but by this time in my teaching career I think I have had just about every type of student. Earlier this year to relieve my stress I started categorizing and sketching out each student type (Comic artist Daniel Clowes already touched on this categorization in his great comic, Art School Confidential). What I wound up with are these 16 types. Over time, I may discover that there are more types or new names for them (ie: goth is now something called emo). Originally I had excluded the average/good students because average/good is not very funny but with much pleading and begging I added it in.
