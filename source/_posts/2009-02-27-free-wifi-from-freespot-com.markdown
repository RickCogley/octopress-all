FreeSpot.com offers **free WiFi in Japan**, and here's a map of their WiFi [access points](http://www.freespot.com/users/map_e.html). I can't vouch for the quality of this service, but I thought it might be worth a try for visitors to Japan who need WiFi. There are WiFi services via ISPs, but you need an account, which is not practical for a short visit. If you try it, please let me know how it worked, or not, in the comments.
