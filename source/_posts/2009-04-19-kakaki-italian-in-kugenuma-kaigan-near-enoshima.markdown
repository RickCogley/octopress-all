[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3454062021 "View 'Kakaki Italian in Enoshima' on Flickr.com")During my 56 km bike ride today, I ate at this [nice little Italian place](http://members.ld.infoseek.co.jp/shonan_guide/kakaki.htm) called "**Kakaki**" in _Kugenuma Kaigan_ near Enoshima, at Kugenuma-bashi, along Rt. 134 the coast road. 


**Address**: Kugenuma Kaigan 2-17-21, Fujisawa


**Tel**: 0466-34-4483


**Hours**: 11:30 AM-14:30 PM, 17:30 PM-21:00 PM, Closed Mondays


**Nearest Station**: Kugenuma Kaigan (5 min walk from there)


**Parking**: 4 spaces


The owner, presumably Mr. Kakaki (?), was personable and spoke English. The table help was a charming young lady, who did a great job despite it probably being her first job, judging from her youth. 


The lunch set was about 1500 yen, and included a simple but good vinaigrette salad, "kakaki style" with a little cheese, salami and prosciutto, fresh-baked bread flavored with poppy seed, a choice of pasta and a small dessert. I had the lasagna, which had nice crispy parts and those great-tasting burnt-cheese bits along the edge of the crockery. **Yum**, I'll be back!
