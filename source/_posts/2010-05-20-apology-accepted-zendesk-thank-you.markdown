I have a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth after having been treated that way, but let's let bygones be bygones. I very much appreciate the real grandfathering they have extended to existing customers.  


So, apology accepted, Zendesk, and kudos to you Mikkel for doing the right thing. I am sure it was difficult.
