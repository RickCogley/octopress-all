    I am happy to have had the pleasure of working with Rick in 2005 and 2006. We were deploying an ERP solution in our CooperVision Japan office, and Rick was assigned the role of onsite Project Manager. The initial phase of the project consisted of process gap analysis, hiring of consultants and documentation of market specific requirements. As the project advanced, team members and consultants were brought onsite to support the final project phase and go-live. In addition to his project management, Rick helped others integrate into the CVJ culture, which made for a most enjoyable and successful project. May 16, 2010

  When I started at CooperVision, it was actually Ocular Sciences before they were acquired. I was asked to initially perform some investigative consulting by local CFO Yoshihiro Kamikura and global CIO Ken Hurley, relating to some unexplained project investments for a logistics center. That is an interesting story in and of itself, but suffice to say, the investigation was the launching point for a few years of consulting work in an organization with an established local IT department, working to do multiple challenging projects on top of an ERP rollout (and all the drama that goes with). Or actually, a couple of ERP rollouts. 
  <br /> <br />
  After we established exactly how much investment into the logistics center had already been made, we moved on to establishing that operation, while we began to plan out an ERP system. Ocular Sciences had acquired some entities in Japan, who had their own systems including an antiquated, home-rolled business system running on AS/400. This system was far removed from being able to be connected with any central US systems (or any domestic ones for that matter), so to give the US executive team their required visibility, US IT was trying to replace the Japan AS/400 with something flexible and modern. There were larger plans than just Japan though, so we kicked off the many steps needed to implement an ERP system. 
  <br /> <br />
  Ken Hurley hired experienced top ERP project director Jack Czajowski to take the reins of the global ERP rollout and establish a Program Management Office, and it was through their skillful leadership that we chose an ERP platform, and a vendor to deploy the system globally. The difference in the nature of the platforms we considered, mainly SAP and Oracle, was as interesting as the differences between the potential roll-out vendors. SAP was all about an almost paternalistic pre-built modularity, while Oracle was all about not assuming what is required, and building a bespoke system. The extensive vendor presentations we observed ranged from an arrogant "how dare you ask us questions" to a very new-age, almost comically meditative approach.

  <h3>Folks I have an announcement...</h3>
  At our first global meeting for the project and actually for IT in general, we were psyched to really get the project rolling. IT people from all corners of the globe had descended upon San Francisco, and we were waiting to start a session when Ken Hurley came into the room. He told us he had an important announcement, that Ocular Sciences was being acquired by CooperVision, and that there were a lot of uncertainties, not least of which with the global ERP project we'd really just got started.
