    I am happy to have had the pleasure of working with Rick in 2005 and 2006. We were deploying an ERP solution in our CooperVision Japan office, and Rick was assigned the role of onsite Project Manager. The initial phase of the project consisted of process gap analysis, hiring of consultants and documentation of market specific requirements. As the project advanced, team members and consultants were brought onsite to support the final project phase and go-live. In addition to his project management, Rick helped others integrate into the CVJ culture, which made for a most enjoyable and successful project. May 16, 2010

  When I started at CooperVision it was not yet CooperVision, but rather called Ocular Sciences. I was by asked to initially perform some investigative consulting by local CFO Yoshihiro Kamikura and global CIO Ken Hurley, relating to some unexplained project investments for a logistics center. That is an interesting story in and of itself, but suffice to say, the investigation was the launching point for a few years of consulting work in an organization with an established local IT department, working to do multiple challenging projects on top of an ERP rollout. Or actually, a couple of ERP rollouts. 
  <br /> <br />
  After we established exactly how much investment into the logistics center had already been made, we moved on to trying to define that operation, while starting to plan out an ERP system. Ocular Sciences had acquired some entities in Japan, who had their own systems including an antiquated, home-rolled business system running on AS/400. This system was far removed from being able to be connected with any central US systems, so the US executive team wanted visibility, and to give that, US IT was trying to replace the AS/400 with something else. There were larger plans than just Japan though, so we started all the many steps needed to implement an ERP system. 
  <br /> <br />
  Ken Hurley had hired experienced ERP project director Jack Czajowski to take the reins of the global ERP rollout, and it was through their skillful leadership that a platform was chosen, and a vendor was chosen to roll it out globally. ... more to come
