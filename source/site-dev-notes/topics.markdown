Topics are used for static "article" pages, which are different from chronological blog posts. Alistapart.com has a good topics structure. 

Apparently, you can change the categories to be called topics, and, can cause them to appear under whatever you want to call the blog. 

For example, /articles/topics/japan/ to see all posts marked Japan, and /articles/2013/01/10/some_post.html for blog posts.

###Usage###

* Keep categories general. No reason to separate Japan categories from other categories.
* Use the most natural between singular and plural forms, leaning toward plural. 
* Use tags and keywords for specifics, and synonyms and singular forms for categories. For example, if the category is Reviews, you can add tags and keywords Review.
