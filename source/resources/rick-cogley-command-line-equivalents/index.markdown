When moving from one version to another, or, from a known system to an unknown system, it is useful to have a reference point for comparison. For example, if I know that ``dir`` lists the directory in DOS, then it would help me, when I am learning Linux, to know that ``dir`` is ``ls``, to help bootstrap my efforts. The below tables are an attempt to compare typical DOS and Linux command line interface commands.
