==USAGE==

* Keep categories general. No reason to separate Japan categories from other categories.
* Use the most natural between singular and plural forms, leaning toward plural. 
* Use tags and keywords for specifics, and synonyms and singular forms for categories. For example, if the category is Reviews, you can add tags and keywords Review.
