On a Logistics provider warehouse tour today, a sign reminded me of the famous "5 Ss".   

    *  整理整頓 【せいりせいとん】 (n,vs) keeping things tidy and in order; ED
    * 清潔 【せいけつ】 (adj-na,n) (1) clean; hygenic; sanitary; (2) pure; virtuous; immaculate; (P); EP
    * 清掃 【せいそう】 (n,vs) cleaning; (P); EP
    * 躾 【しつけ】 (n) (uk) home discipline; training; upbringing; breeding; (P); EP


Five S’s :: these are 5 terms that all begin with the letter ‘S’ that are intended to make your work environment suitable for Lean. They are, with rough English translations also starting with ‘S’ in brackets, Seiri (Sort), Seiton (Set in Order), Seiso (Shine), Seiketso (Standardise) and Shitsuke (Sustain).


   Description of the Lean Method

In 1990, a group of MIT professors led by Prof. James P. Womack published the book The Machine that Changed the World (MIT Press). Their objective was to send a message to the traditional world of mass production. They cited a wealth of benchmarking data to show that there is a better way to organize and manage the entire operation, known as the Toyota Production System (TPS). They labeled this method the Lean Production because it produces more with lower costs, less effort, less time, less space, and less energy.

The Lean approach offers extraordinary productivity improvements, often in the range of 30-50% on the first attempt. This significant improvement is accomplished because traditional mass-production methods result in massive but hard to detect waste throughout the entire production system. Lean Production is a set of mutually coupled techniques that include: Value Definition; Value Stream Mapping; Just-in-Time; Flow; Pull; Jidoka; Standard Work; Preventive Maintenance; Level Production; Fast Changeover; Multi-Process Operations; Visual Controls; local Quality Assurance; Kanban; Kaizen, Training; and several others. Large amounts of waste may be found in: inventory; unnecessary processing and transport/conveyance of parts; poor plant layout and task sequencing; poor work organization; work pieces, tools, parts and people; large variability; defects; a poor supply chain; and last but not least, energy waste in processes and plant operations.

The book created great demand in industry for more information on Lean Methods. In response, the authors published a second book in 1996, titled Lean Thinking providing instruction in Lean methods, including implementation procedures and case studies from large, medium and small U.S. and European enterprises. The Lean methods spread through U.S. industry, starting in automobile plants. The aerospace industry followed with the MIT-led Lean Aerospace Initiative.

Lean and Total Quality are credited with restoring competitive leadership and vast productivity increases in US manufacturing.

The method of 5 S's is an important part of Lean. Named after five Japanese concepts, the 5 S's is a set of workplace organization or housekeeping rules for keeping the factory in perfect order. The method is regarded as a prerequisite for Lean. The 5 S's include:

Seiri - sorting, i.e., proper arrangement of all items, storage, equipment, tools, inventory and traffic
Seiton - orderliness
Seiso - cleanliness
Seiketsu - standardization, and
Shitsuke - self-discipline

Among others, the LMU IAC team will identify any major problems with the Lean production and 5 S's in the plant, assess their impact on energy, and make specific recommendations and reading suggestions.</div>
