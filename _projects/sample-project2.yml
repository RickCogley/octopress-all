  body:
    My first direct experience with Rick was in early 2008 when he "auditioned" himself and his company by participating in a vendor negotiation for IT related installations in our new Tokyo office. Within that hour of discussion Rick's talent and skills became clearly evident and by the end of the evening he had won our business. In the years that have followed I've never regretted that decision as Rick's abilities and care for his clients permeated throughout his entire business and team.
